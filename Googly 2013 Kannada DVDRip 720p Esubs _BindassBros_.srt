154
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,630
इयं कीद्रशा प्रतिक्रिया?

155
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,160
Why are you so happy?
किमर्थं एतावत् उल्लासः?


156
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,500
Food in your hostel is really good.
तव आवासे भोजनं बहु स्वादिष्टमेव.

157
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,360
Just like the food in my orphanage.
मम अनाथाश्रमे इव

158
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,860
Wow! Good
बहुसमीचिनम्!

159
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,360
कस्माद्चित् कालात् प्रष्टुमैच्छम् यत्

160
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:31,730
who is this Sharath ?
कः शरतः?
Why entire college hate him?
कलाशालायां सर्वैः किमर्थं द्विष्टः?

161
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:36,500
Madhu Stop there!
मधो! तिष्ठ!
What happened? किं जातम्?

162
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:39,360
You've come to this college
today only.
अद्यैव कलाशाला आगम्यते?

163
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,300
Do you need to know about
that mental case?
तस्य उन्मादस्य विषयं ज्ञातुमावश्यकं वा?

164
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:44,870
Nothing like that
I found him interesting.
केवलं रोचकः इति मन्ये.

165
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:48,040
He's not interesting character
but irritating character.
रोचकः न सः क्षोभकः.

166
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,560
He hates love and girls.
सः प्रेम कन्यः द्वेष्टि.

167
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:56,280
But he beat a man for teasing
a girl, right?
किन्तु कनीपीडकम् ताडितवान् किल?

168
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,860
Yes.
आम्!
- Why is it so?
- किमर्थम्?

169
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:00,860
Had I known so much about him,
यदि तावत् ज्ञातम्

170
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:04,760
I would be the senior most
patient in mental hospital.
मनोरुग्णालये वरिष्ठरोगिनी अभविष्यमेव

171
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,900
Why?
किमर्थम्?

172
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:12,880
One of my friend Sheetal, was very
 beautiful, went to propose to him.
 मम एकं मित्रम् अस्ति, शीतला. सा बहुसुन्दरा. तया प्रेमनिवेदनं कृतम्.

173
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,960
Sharath
शरत?
- Yes
- किम्?

174
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,240
I love you
त्वयि स्निह्यामि!
- Oh!
- एवं वा!

175
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:23,960
Can't hear if there is an ear bud in ear.
यदि श्रवणयन्त्रं कर्णयोः धारयामि कथं श्रूयते

176
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,360
What did you tell now?
किम् उक्तम्?
Repeat.
पुनर्वद!

177
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,560
So many boys are after me.
कतिपयाः लाडिकाः मां कामयन्ति

178
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:32,720
But nobody has made me go
mad as much as you have.
किन्तु त्वम् इव कोऽपि न मामुन्मादं कृतम्

179
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:36,930
Please accept my sincere love.
कृपया मम निजं प्रेमनिवेदनं स्वीकुरु.

180
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:38,930
I love you
त्वयि स्निह्यामि

181
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,000
Am I your 10th victim?
तव दशमाखेटः अस्मि किल?

182
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:54,000
I've seen 4 boys who were
with you go to the saloon,
त्वया सह लाडिकचतुष्कम् शुण्डाम् प्रति गच्छमानम् दृष्टम् 

183
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,100
three others went down the lane,
अन्यत् त्रयं विथ्याम् अग्रे गतवत्

184
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:59,560
news channels tell about others
vanishing from the world.
अन्ये तु जगतः अदृश्यं अभवत् इति दूरदर्शनेन भणितम्

185
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,400
What are you planning to do with me?
माम् किम् कर्तुम् कल्पितम्?
- Nothing like that.
- न किमपि एव.

186
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,960
I'm in love with you very seriously.
त्वयि स्निह्यामि तीव्रमेव

187
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,900
They were waste candidates.
ते तु मूर्खाः एव.

188
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:10,120
Okay, leave it.
साधु, मास्तु

189
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,860
Once candle wax melts,
wick is indeed useless.
द्रवीकरणतः परम् शलाका तु व्यर्थैव

190
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,860
This is latest fashion of girls.
कन्यानाम् अद्यतना रीतिः एव

191
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:21,760
Fashion of girls is tension for boys, it then
 leads to emotion and ultimately to rat poison.
कन्यानाम् रीतिः तु लडिकानाम् आततिः, ततः परम् भावे परिवर्तते अन्ततः तु मूषकविषे

192
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:23,460
Do I need this?
आवश्यकम् वा?

193
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,530
Sharath
शरत

194
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:29,930
You girls ask for big money in
their wallets too along with lover.
कन्यः तु प्रेमिणा सह बृहत्कधनस्यूतम् वाञ्छन्ति

195
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:36,730
You loved 9 boys before me, did you ever
buy even a ₹ 0.50 chocolate for them?
इतः पूर्वम् नव लाडिकेषु स्निह्यति स्म, कदापि तेभ्यः पञ्चाशत्पैसमूल्यम् चाकलेहम् अपि क्रीतवती वा?

196
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:40,970
You know what, I didn't have ₹ 0.50 change.
ज्ञातं वा मम पञ्चाशत्पैसाः न अस्ति

197
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,470
Great!
बहुसमीचिनम्!
- I never asked them anything.
कदापि किमपि वस्तु न प्रार्थितम्.

198
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,830
They bought gifts for me
on their own will.
ते तु स्वेच्छया सर्वान् उपहारान् दत्तवन्तः

199
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:50,160
I accepted it to keep them happy.
तान् सुखयितुं सर्वे उपहाराः स्वीकृताः
That's all!
तदर्थमेव!

200
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,800
Why are you asking about past?
गतकालस्य विषयं कथं पृच्छसि?
Leave it, Sharath.
मास्तु, शरत

201
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,600
What do you want, dear?
किम् इच्छसि, प्रिये?

202
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:59,280
Should I jump down from this
 roof or will you push me down?
अत्रतः मम कूर्दनम् अथवा तव नोदः?

203
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,660
Are you joking, Sharath?
शरत, परिहासम् करोषि वा?

204
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:08,380
Ever since you girls gave
the arrow of love to boys,
यदा युष्माभिः कनीभिः कामबाणम् मुञ्चन्ति स्म

205
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:12,180
we poor men do look like
jokers to you, right?
तत्समयतः वयं दरिद्राः लाडिकाः परिहासकाः इव दृश्यन्ते किल?

206
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,330
एवं वा? न जाने?

207
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:22,540
इष्टिकया आत्मानं ताडितवान्?

208
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,020
तव प्रेम धिक् अस्तु! त्वं धिक्!

209
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:29,200
तादृशः किमर्थम् वर्तते?
- कः जानाति एव?

210
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:35,220
तस्य विषये यदि बहु चिन्तसि चेत् तव पक्वकेशः भवति,

211
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:38,040
अथ वरान्वेषणं कष्टं भवति।
नूनं शयनं कुरु।

212
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,200
शुभरात्रिः

213
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:46,320
रोचते सः?
शुभारात्रिः।

214
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:51,060
406! घृतं नय।

215
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,660
406?

216
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,440
त्वम् अधिकारी वा?
अहं पुररक्षः?

217
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,800
आरक्ष्याधिकारी भवेः इति वदसि किल?

218
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:03,000
निजः अधिकारी भवेः इति उक्तम्

219
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,670
भाटकवस्त्रं धारयित्वा समाजेन निन्द्यस्व इति न उक्तम्

220
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:11,260
एकदिनं यावदेव आरक्षिवस्त्रं धारयामि चेत् इयत् तर्जसि,
यदि यावद्जीवितम् धारयामि मम अन्तं भवेदेव।

221
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:15,710
सप्ताहपर्यन्तं धारयामि। यावत् आवश्यकं तावत् पश्य। तदनन्तरम् प्रतिदीयताम्।

222
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:17,710
घृतं परिवेषय। चोराः गृह्यन्ताम्।

223
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,380
Nothing short in this act.

224
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:22,480
I tried a lot to keep you away
from following your dad.

225
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:24,120
I failed.

226
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,460
That's okay, where is dad?

227
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,560
He'll be on TV, watch it.

228
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:33,030
It was same in Lord Ram's marriage too.

229
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:37,100
Why I'm telling you this is because
bad time is looming large on you.

230
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:40,110
To avoid this every Saturday...

231
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,320
Daddy is after Saturn today.

232
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,120
What else your dad has to do?

233
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:49,760
He worried about future
of everyone except you.

234
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,780
You're like this and
he's like that.

235
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,620
I'm fed up with you both.

236
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:58,250
I'm also fed up with
this Bangalore traffic.

237
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:00,910
Astrology scholar is here only!
What about that?

238
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:03,260
That's pre-recorded.
To hell with it.

239
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:08,700
Why are you wearing police dress?
- That is for my mother.

240
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,280
Look Sharath, don't listen
to your mother,

241
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,100
Why I'm telling you is

242
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:18,550
It's true I loved your mother.

243
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:21,450
It wasn't compulsory to
marry the girl you love.

244
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,810
But listening to my mother,
I married your mother.

245
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:28,610
The moment I married her
and my future vanished.

246
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:30,710
I'm foretelling the future
of this world.

247
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,880
A love marriage here too!

248
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,680
Your future turned bright
after I married you.

249
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,640
I was just joking, Kausalya.

250
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,330
Forget about our future.

251
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:44,610
I've studied your son's future.
It's very bright.

252
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:47,330
He'll do so much that this
world will celebrate him.

253
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:50,220
I'll ask you a question, dad.

254
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:54,100
Think and answer me correctly.

255
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:59,270
I topped the college, would my principal
select me for Indian Economic Forum?

256
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:02,120
I must do.
I must do it.

257
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:06,060
He's college topper.
Principal says we must select him.

258
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:10,460
Forget about him, Forum is happening
in our college campus.

259
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:13,580
Internationally reputed corporate
companies are coming here.

260
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:16,400
Arrange everything perfectly.
Got it?

261
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,190
Don't forget it.

262
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,300
Hello vice-principal!

263
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,320
1 minute. You can go now.
- OK, sir.

264
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:29,160
It seems you wanted to meet me, sir.

265
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:32,280
Why don't you respect me
with people around?

266
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:34,860
You respect me when nobody is around.

267
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:38,910
I can't understand your character.
- I'm like that...different.

268
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,130
What's the use if I'm like everyone else?
Everyone must fear me, sir.

269
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:46,720
Fearsome are more powerful.
What do you say?

270
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:48,550
Okay, forgive me.

271
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:52,060
I've selected you to represent
at Indian Economic Forum.

272
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,360
Take this letter.

273
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:56,280
Thank you

274
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,880
One minute.

275
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:00,310
You're very brilliant.

276
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:04,130
My bad luck Forum is being
organized in our college.

277
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:06,460
Students from other colleges
would be here.

278
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,600
People of International reputed
companies would be here.

279
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,340
I consider this as your legs.

280
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,630
I beg you,
please don't attend the Forum.

281
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:16,780
Please save our college honor.

282
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:19,800
Anyhow you've selected me, right?

283
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:23,160
I can't avoid because
you're the college topper.

284
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,110
If not it'll dishonor
our college.

285
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:28,360
That's why, please do something
and withdraw yourself.

286
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,130
Save out college honor.

287
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:33,630
You say no need of murder,
commit suicide.

288
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:37,740
Don't worry sir,
the flag of our college honor

289
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,820
Flag of honor?

290
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:42,000
I love to dishonor it more
than honor, so I'll go.

291
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,960
What?
- Go that side.

292
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:59,080

Medical, Commerce, Engineering
Any degree

298
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:23,360
but it must help our country
to develop economically.

299
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,640
Now 1st candidate
Tejas

300
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,980
Good mourning everyone
I'm Tejaswi

304
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:43,240
This plan is regarding
 the industrialization of India

305
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:49,940
which requests crores of money for the betterment of
 infrastructure of our industries which we can't afford.

306
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,940
Thank you very much

307
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,300
Hi, I'm Madhu from Global College

308

Our next candidate

00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,340
Mr. Sharath from Global College

313
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,700
Hey look, he's sleeping
- Quiet

314
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,280
What bothers you? Keep quiet.

315
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:47,050
Mr. Sharath, we'll call your
 name for the last 3 times.

316
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:49,220
Or else your name
 will be eliminated.

317
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:52,080
No need, let him sleep.
It's necessary for him.

318
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:52,260
What are you saying?
Will you go or shall I go?
No need, let him sleep.
It's necessary for him.

319
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,340
What are you saying?
Will you go or shall I go?

320
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,440
No, you don't need to wake him up.
- If you don't, I'll do it.

321
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,060
I said no.
- I'm going.

322
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:00,500
Swathi

323
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,720
Sharath

324
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,620
Sharath

325
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,240
Sharath

326
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:12,220
Sharath
- Mr. Sharath

327
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:14,220
This is the last call for you.

328
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:16,420
Or else you'll be eliminated
- Sharath

329
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,420
Sharath

330
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:38,980
Present sir.

331
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:42,620
Oh god!
- Crazy guy

332
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:00,100
I had millet balls early morning,
so I slept.

333
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,240
What should I do now?
- Tell about your project.

334
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,960
Okay.

335
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,580
My name is Sharath.

336
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,860
I'm a Commerce student .

337
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:23,760
Many from this stage talked about
businesses with crores of investment,

338
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:27,000
but nobody could guide how to get
those crore for the investment,

339
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:29,030
that's why I slept.

340
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:33,010
I'll not take much of your time,
I'll come straight to the matter ,

341
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:37,630
it's very easy to get money for
investment in our country.

342
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:38,700
How is that?

343
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:42,850
<font size="28"> [Actual Answer: Approximately 1.22 billion (As of 2014) ] </font>
What's our nation's population?
- 120 crores?

344
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,810
That's the only one thing we exceed!

345
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,750
If we get each one of them
to invest ₹ 1,

346
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:55,250
we'll get ₹ 120 crores, do we need
anything more than this investment?

347
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:57,210
Interesting,
How to do it?

348
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:01,380
Select me for the next round,
I'll answer you then.

349
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:04,280
Very clever

350
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,000
What a plan! Super
- Yes..yes...

351
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:09,980
OK. Fans must maintain restrain.

352
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:15,040
Excellent!
- Him and his plan?

353
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,760
Only you must appreciate him.

354
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:19,680
Thank you.
- Nice

355
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,640
That's a very good project, Mr. Sharath

356
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:45,080
Last but not least candidate
Miss Swathi

357
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:47,540
All the best
- Thank you

358
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:54,540
Hi, I'm Swathi.
I'm a Medical student

359
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:58,670
As Sharath said our nation is
highly populated,

360
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:01,800
we must use it as man power.

361
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:06,080
This means improving the health
of our people very important.

362
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:11,800
In order to do that, we have to make sure that every
 facility is available at every part of our country.

363
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,340
So that any person, rich or poor,
is able to get that facility

364
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,140
Thank you

365
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:38,360
OK. Thank you all very much.

366
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:42,480
Results will be on boards and
through SMS's to your mobiles.

367
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:45,280
Thank you all once again.
You all can leave now.

368
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:50,080
Why did you wake up that mental man?

369
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:54,150
If you didn't, he would've got
eliminated from the Forum.

370
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:59,600
No, not like that, we knew about his
idea only after waking him up, right?

371
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:04,000
I think he's pretty brilliant.
How simply he told his idea!

372
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:09,080
If I hadn't, we would've missed
a good plan.

373
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:15,620
You waked him up,
did he at least thank you for that?

374
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:21,440
No! But mostly he would be
thinking about my help, right?

375
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:31,240
Sharath

376
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,240
Wake up

377
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:35,240
Sharath

378
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:42,140
Sharath

379
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:56,280
Sharath

380
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,260
Dad!
- What's it, Sharath?

381
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:20,560
Yours was a love marriage, right?.

382
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,880
Indeed love marriage
but she has forgotten it.

383
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:29,580
Why are you raking up old memories?

384
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:32,310
Should I tell you about my love story
at this unearthly hour?

385
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:35,710
No dad, when you first saw mother,

386
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:39,680
<font size="28"> [Mohini: The only female avatar of the Hindu god Vishnu] </font>
did she appear everywhere
and in everything you saw like Mohini?

387
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:43,980
Indeed Mohini!
She was then and now too!

388
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,510
I know I can see her
even after I die.

389
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:50,620
That's why they're called Mohini.
- I too feel like that.

390
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:51,950
You?

391
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,060
Mohini?

392
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:55,480
Who is she?

393
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:58,280
Nobody!

394
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,450
Go daddy!
- Okay.

395
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,450
Go?

396
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,380
He's doing something!

397
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:10,060
I must tie Lord Anjaneya's
amulet to him. Go?

398
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:21,420
First time, something is happening.

399
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:22,630
I've insomnia.

400
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,740
Don't know why!

401
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:33,000
She woke me up, right?

402
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:38,600
Go to hell!

403
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:40,200
I must thank her tomorrow.

404
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:43,600
I must talk to him tomorrow.

405
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:49,520
How do I call girls?

406
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:54,530
I don't have any knowledge about girls!

407
00:33:56,290 --> 00:34:02,000
Is it necessary to search
for a girl to say thanks?

408
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Idea cancel
- Hi

409
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:07,940
Hi

410
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,560
Thanks
- Why?

411
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:17,490
While I was asleep,
for waking me up like bed bug.

412
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:19,940
Like bed bug?

413
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:22,020
What a comparison
Sorry

414
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,420
What should I say to him?

415
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,700
I'm Swati
Medical student

416
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:40,070
Greetings.
- Greetings!

417
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:42,940
Sharath
- I know

418
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:47,330
Shall we have a coffee?
- No need

419
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,300
No?
OK

420
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:53,190
Coffee heats up body.

421
00:34:54,490 --> 00:34:55,890
Shall we have sugar cane juice?

422
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,120
Sure

423
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,220
Do you know sugar cane juice
has more heat than coffee?

424
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,860
Is it?

425
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,660
Leave it, youth must always be hot.

426
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:30,600
Tell me!
- What?

427
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:32,960
About you.
- Why?

428
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:39,930
Ever since I came here I've been
watching you till you spoke yesterday.

429
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:44,800
I found you different, special
and interesting.

430
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:48,520
I'm curious to know about you.

431
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:51,200
Which college are you from?

432
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,720
Mysore Medical College
Why?

433
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:59,270
You stay in Mysore about
140 km away from Bangalore,

434
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,820
but you're realized I'm an
interesting character,

435
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:06,900
but nobody in my college right from
principal to peon don't know this.

436
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:11,220
Look madam, can I call you as doctor?

437
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,700
Yes. OK

438
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:18,000
Look doctor, if you're the only one
who finds me interesting,

439
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:20,700
then I'm sure you too would be
quite an interesting personality.

440
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,500
Thanks

441
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,420
Would you like to have another
glass of sugar cane juice?

442
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:25,830
No...no...enough.

443
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:27,760
How much, brother?
- ₹ 20, brother.

444
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,700
It's ₹ 20, pay him.
Party is yours, right?

445
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,870
Had we gone to Coffee Day,
you would've spend ₹ 300.

446
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:39,400
See how this is over with just ₹ 20.
- Thanks

447
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,280
Sharath

448
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:49,400
Why do you hate girls and love?

449
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:52,800
Who said that?
- I got the news.

450
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,100
It's all rumors spread
by my enemies.

451
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:00,800
I hate girls.
But I like love.

452
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:01,900
Why is it so?

453
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,430
There are no good girls to fall in love,

454
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:04,620
girls are mad after love
but is it sincere?
There are no good girls to fall in love,

455
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:08,170
girls are mad after love
but is it sincere?

456
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:13,570
Powerful youth has gone waste going
for this magical word love.

457
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:18,400
I'll tell you a thing,
love is like an ice cream,

458
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:22,470
you look around and see, all you're
left with is just the stick.

459
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:25,400
Whether to keep it or throw,
if kept, where to keep it?

460
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,400
It's a lifelong confusion!

461
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,900
That's why I'll have only
cup ice cream.

462
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,100
Cup ice cream?

463
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:35,530
Hello...
- Come...come...

464
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:40,030
As love hits the young men,

465
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,780
first act will be on the
purse of the young men,

466
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:47,580
Whether love succeeds or fails,
it'll make hole to his purse.

467
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:54,700
If it is success hotel, films, dinner,
gift, mobile bills, petrol, etc.,

468
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:59,200
If it fails brandy, whiskey,
cigarette, marijuana, insecticide.

469
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:03,400
Whether love succeeds or fails,
only boys get ruined.

470
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:06,380
I think you're wrong.

471
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:10,000
Did you know Shah Jahan built
Taj Mahal for love?

472
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:14,000
I know it.
It isn't the mistake of Shah Jahan.

473
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:17,960
If any neighbor kingdom had
waged war with him,

474
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:21,900
forget about building Taj Mahal,
he wouldn't have time to think also.

475
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:26,100
True love has no value
in modern times.

476
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,160
<font size="28"> [Frankincense: An aromatic gum resin (sticky substance) obtained from an African tree and burnt as incense] </font>
Girls now are like frankincense,

477
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:29,360
<font size="28"> [Frankincense: An aromatic gum resin (sticky substance) obtained from an African tree and burnt as incense] </font>

478
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:32,830
they spread fragrance till we blow air,
<font size="28"> [Frankincense: An aromatic gum resin (sticky substance) obtained from an African tree and burnt as incense] </font>

479
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:35,300
the moment boys stop blowing air,

480
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:38,000
they throw boys like hot potatoes
and kill us.

481
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:42,060
We smoke but never smoke anyone.

482
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,760
Look, I think you've misconception.

483
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:47,280
All girls are not like that.
there are good girls too.

484
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,130
That's true.

485
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,530
Girls are of 2 types.

486
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:54,480
One is pure milk,
another is pure phenol.

487
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:58,340
Boys spend their lifetime
to find this difference.

488
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:04,700
But you are...pure milk.
You're not phenol like other girls.

489
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,030
Why?

490
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:10,000
When I asked, you paid happily
for the sugar cane juice.

491
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:13,700
Take it.
- No need.

492
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,660
Keep it.
- Why?

493
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,420
It's an insult to men if they
make women pay for a drink.

494
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:21,100
Didn't you fall in love
with anyone?

495
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:22,740
Love?
- Yes.

496
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:23,930
Me?
- Yes.

497
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:25,830
No chance.

498
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:32,220
Boys tell me that if you fall in love,
she appears in dreams and everywhere.

499
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:34,860
You mean?
- I mean...

500
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:38,120
Never any girl has appeared in
my dream or in my mirror.

501
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:39,530
Stop here.

502
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:41,160
I...
- Hey Sharath

503
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,430
What are doing here without
going to college?

504
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,100
Cigarette too!

505
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:50,370
I've brought an amulet from the
temple of Lord Anjaneya. Tie it.

506
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:51,560
Why?

507
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:57,200
You said some girl appeared in dream
and was waking you up.

508
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,760
That's why I got you this amulet
Tie it.

509
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:05,300
He's my creator.

510
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:06,560
She's Swathi.
- Sharath

511
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:08,630
Creator means?
- Father!

512
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:10,100
Greetings.
- Greetings.

513
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,900
Is she the girl who would carry
our family's future?

514
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,260
She's beautiful.

515
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:18,440
Dad, just go as you came.

516
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,120
I'll go son, auto is waiting, right?.

517
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:23,420
I've put up a lot to maintain,
don't bring it down, dad.

518
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:27,000
I beg you, dad, go home.
- I'll go but she's very nice.

519
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,300
She doesn't have the Mohini
features of your mom.

520
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,120
You go, dad.

521
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:33,700
Don't leave her,
hold tightly, be careful.

522
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:36,500
Swathi, please tell him to quit smoking.

523
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:39,060
He'll listen to you.
- Take him to home straight.

524
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:41,380
I'll go. You don't let me take
a good look at her.

525
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:43,380
Bye uncle

526
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:49,360
Why are you laughing?

527
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:51,790
That is...nothing.

528
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:59,080
Selected for next round.
- Congrats

529
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,080
Thank you

530
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,360
I'm also selected, look at this.

531
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:10,760
Is it?
- Won't you congratulate me?

532
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:15,330
I'm not in mood now. I'll congratulate
 when we meet next time.

533
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,480
OK

534
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:25,700
If you ever come before me again,

535
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:28,860
don't push your hair like this, okay?
- Why?

536
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:30,790
I'm not in a mood to tell you that.

537
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:32,830
Why am I talking to you so much?

538
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,200
Am I a fool?

539
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:37,400
I'm not well.
- Hello...OK bye

540
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:40,860
I'm not in a mood to say bye also,
I'll say it next time when we meet.

541
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:45,290
If I stay here for few more minutes,
I feel I'll go mad.

542
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,460
Take it, son.
- Thank you

543
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,700
Tell me.

544
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:55,640
Tell me now, who was that girl?
- Girl?

545
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:00,540
Player Father!

546
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:04,940
Are you offering me a drink to make
me talk about that girl, right?

547
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:07,010
So be it.
Come on, tell me.

548
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,240
She's doctor bed bug,
she bites to wake up sleeping people.

549
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:18,270
That bed bug has bitten
specially my son.

550
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,540
Nothing like that, dad.

551
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:22,840
I've applied coconut oil,
I'll be fine.

552
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,040
What's fine?

553
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:26,640
You talked to that mental man
for so long.

554
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:30,980
I must get you checked up in
NIMHANS Hospital tomorrow morning.

555
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:32,270
Come on, Madhu

556
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:39,100
You've misunderstood him. He's very nice but
 straight forward. It appears like madness to you.

557
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:43,740
You know I've never
talked to any boy so much.

558
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:47,970
But he's disturbing me in
a different way.

559
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:53,310
Hey! What are you saying?
Are you in love with him?

560
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:55,680
Are you mad?
- Yes, you are mad

561
00:42:56,070 --> 00:43:00,310
My heart says you would get bitten
by that bug all your life.

562
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:04,040
Is it?
- It means you don't love him, right?

563
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:06,980
I feel so.

564
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:10,280
No need to feel,
I can see it on your face.

565
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:13,660
You've fallen for her.
You're madly in love with her.

566
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:16,550
I too was like you
when I saw your mother.

567
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:24,120
Daddy, so many have told
Love is waste over this drink.

568
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:27,170
Listen carefully
what I'm telling you now.

569
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:31,740
Those who couldn't keep their love
talk bad about love.

570
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:35,070
But how happy people are
who got true love!

571
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:38,620
Look at me!
You too are happy. You know why?

572
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:40,740
Because you're in love.

573
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:48,240
Go to your bedroom if not
 I'll definitely beat you.

574
00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:52,740
You're drunk, I'll go,
come carefully, son.

575
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:55,320
Don't fall.

576
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:57,040
Fall in love

577
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,100
Father!

578
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:01,680
Anyhow it's good you don't love him.

579
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:06,700
I'm feeling sleepy.
- Go to bed, I'll come.

580
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:07,820
Okay.

581
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:14,070
Am I in love with doctor bug
as my dad says?

582
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:19,820
If I knew her phone number,
I would've asked her.

583
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:22,200
He should've asked about
this confusion.

584
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:30,660
No...me...in love...me...no chance.

585
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:34,400
I haven't fallen for her.

586
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:38,260
So dear candidates

587
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:40,520
100 were selected for 1st round,

588
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:44,060
just 10 are selected for
the 2nd round.

589
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:46,300
It gets difficult from here.

590
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:49,020
The level of difficulty just increased.

591
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:50,400
And by the way,

592
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:55,730
We had announced award for the most
difficult and different project.

593
00:44:56,300 --> 00:45:00,280
And that award goes to
Miss Swathi

594
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:03,720
Congratulations
- Congratulations Miss Swathi. Please come to stage.

595
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:16,740
Thank you. Thank you, sir.
- Congratulations

596
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:20,340
Swathi, Congratulations

597
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:21,760
I won
- I'm so happy.

598
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,720
Congratulations
- Thank you

599
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,660
Your presentation was very nice.
- Actually that was...

600
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,120
I'll be back in 5 minutes!

601
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:36,500
Hi

602
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:38,200
Bye
- What?

603
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:41,340
I wasn't in mood that day,
so I said bye now.

604
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:42,980
OK

605
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:44,880
Congrats
- Thanks

606
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:47,620
I wasn't in mood that day,
so I said now. Keep it.

607
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:52,660
I thought you'd get this award
but how I got...

608
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:55,020
How is it possible that
we both think alike?

609
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:59,250
I thought I would get but
some fools gave it to you.

610
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:01,210
Hey, no.

611
00:46:01,210 --> 00:46:03,800
No smoking inside the campus, right?
- Yeah

612
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:04,840
No need of this.
- Actually

613
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,990
Had I been the judge,
I would've given the award to you.

614
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:11,320
I think you deserve it. So literally this
 award must go to you. Take it, please.

615
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:14,470
No need.
- If you don't accept, I'll get upset.

616
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:17,140
No, you have to take it.
Take it, please.

617
00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:21,280
I said no...
- Please accept it.

618
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:55,620
Swathi, what are you doing here?
Take your bag, let's go.

619
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:58,460
You carry on, I'll come later.
5 minutes.

620
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:00,270
Will you come or not?

621
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:02,240
Come fast.
- Sure

622
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,420
Stupid fellow
- Bye

623
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:04,100
Bye

624
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:11,540
Sorry

625
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:14,740
I pushed back my hair, it's my habit.

626
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,470
Leave it...

627
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:23,970
Will you please give your phone number?

628
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:26,480
Why?

629
00:47:28,570 --> 00:47:31,970
Since we both got selected
for the 2nd round. So,

630
00:47:32,370 --> 00:47:35,240
you know, to discuss about anything...

631
00:47:35,570 --> 00:47:36,510
I can call you, right?

632
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:41,380
I'm Commerce student and
you're a Medical student,

633
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:43,480
Is there anything to discuss between us?

634
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,680
OK bye
- Bye

635
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:54,940
Hello, take down my number.

636
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:57,010
1 second
Tell me.

637
00:47:57,010 --> 00:48:04,620
99 ...00 ...30 ...30...90

638
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:07,420
Send me a message.
- I will send.

639
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,850
What is there to discuss?

640
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:13,340
To ask about morning coffee,
breakfast or say good morning or night.

641
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:18,110
First time I'm giving my number
to a girl.

642
00:48:18,410 --> 00:48:21,940
Me too! First time I'm taking
a boy's number.

643
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:28,240
Leave it, doctor. You're not like other girls.
No second thought about it.

644
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,240
Bye

645
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,240
See you

646
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:48,580
Jupiter in 12th place and
Moon in 9th place!

647
00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:50,510
What else would result!

648
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:52,760
It's happening as I said!

649
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:58,760
Why are you laughing, son?

650
00:48:59,810 --> 00:49:03,510
I'm crying, dad.
- Crying? Why?

651
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:08,650
I too got ruined like all other boys.

652
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:11,450
I've also fallen in love, dad!

653
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:16,180
My god! It's bad omen to cry
like this at midnight.

654
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:20,460
Be happy son to have fallen
in love like all others.

655
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:23,680
Is it?
- Then what?

656
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:25,580
My prediction has come true.

657
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:30,580
I told your mother that our son
would surely fall in love.

658
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:32,850
You've saved this family's honor.

659
00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:35,180
The moment I saw the girl,
I calculated.

660
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:41,250
Every planet around was
in favorable place.

661
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:43,410
You got yourself a good girl.

662
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:45,450
You said the truth, dad.

663
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:49,080
Dad, she is not like other girls.

664
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:52,810
She doesn't change lovers
morning and evening.

665
00:49:53,150 --> 00:49:56,620
She has asked for the
phone number from me only.

666
00:49:56,850 --> 00:49:57,610
Then?

667
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:01,750
Poor girl sacrificed her award for me.

668
00:50:02,110 --> 00:50:07,780
She has proved prize is sweet
and sacrifice is eternal.

669
00:50:08,410 --> 00:50:09,750
What's your future plan?

670
00:50:09,950 --> 00:50:12,850
I'll propose to him next.

671
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:17,580
Swathi, how could you
fall in love with him?

672
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,120
You know how genuine he is?

673
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:26,780
The man who never spoke to
a girl till now,

674
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:31,780
how cute he was with me!
He's so cute

675
00:50:32,610 --> 00:50:35,550
I feel I'll be happy with him.

676
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:39,820
OK, next?

677
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:42,510
Next, I'll go propose my love to her.

678
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:46,380
If I propose to her now,

679
00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:52,420
the touch-me-not name in college
would go to the dogs.

680
00:50:52,610 --> 00:50:55,110
I feel like crying thinking
about it, father.

681
00:50:55,110 --> 00:50:56,480
Shut up!

682
00:50:57,180 --> 00:51:00,610
Love mustn't have any restrictions.

683
00:51:01,210 --> 00:51:02,450
Love mustn't have ego.

684
00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:05,750
There is no place for status in love.

685
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,180
One must become gentle like
football without air.

686
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:11,180
No use in telling you.

687
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:15,250
Her planetary position makes her
to propose first if you don't.

688
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:18,980
That's what you need in life.

689
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:20,510
If that happens,

690
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:24,350
in college I can boast
I didn't go after her,

691
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:30,150
she came after me,
and maintain my range as it is.

692
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:34,620
Dad, tell me she'll express her
love to me.

693
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:35,760
I'll tell him tomorrow.

694
00:51:36,190 --> 00:51:38,300
I'll express my love to him.

695
00:51:38,350 --> 00:51:45,120
No Swathi, look I warned you
not to love but you loved him.

696
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:47,120
It's OK

697
00:51:47,610 --> 00:51:50,110
Please listen to me,

698
00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:52,450
wait for few days,

699
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:55,910
it's better to make him
propose to you.

700
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:58,250
Because he's a strange man.

701
00:51:58,450 --> 00:52:00,010
Let him commit himself to you.

702
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:01,850
Would he propose to me?

703
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:07,420
Look, if you propose and if he
rejects, you'd be in trouble.

704
00:52:08,610 --> 00:52:10,910
Are you confident he would
express his love to you?

705
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:12,310
I do.

706
00:52:12,650 --> 00:52:13,750
Then, forget it.

707
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:15,750
Okay?

708
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:19,480
OK
- Okay for me too.

709
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,950
She'll propose in few days, right?

710
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:26,250
I'll wait till then.
- That's good.

711
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:29,610
Lovers must be alone
when love sprouts.

712
00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:32,880
Grief of separation is an experience.
What else can I tell you?

713
00:52:37,410 --> 00:52:43,720
Fry in pan, pain in love,
if you get cheated, eat jail food.

714
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:46,750
If I like having jail food.

715
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:49,910
I love you, Swathi
- I love you, Sharath

Only 5 have been selected
in 2nd stage.

765
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:26,590
And out of this, the best presentation
award goes to Mr. Sharath

766
00:57:26,590 --> 00:57:28,790
Why is he shouting like that?

767
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:33,460
Good
Congrats

768
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:36,680
Congratulations

769
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:38,680
All the best

770
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:42,200
Congratulations

771
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:47,960
Didn't I tell you that he would
get the award, Madhu?

772
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:50,440
He's so intelligent.
You know what happened

773
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:51,620
Hello doctor!

774
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:55,390
Madhu, he's coming
I'll call you later.

775
00:57:57,180 --> 00:58:00,460
Hi
- Actually

776
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:04,320
I thought they would give the award
to you in this round.

777
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:08,790
Is it?
- Your presentation was so good.

778
00:58:09,390 --> 00:58:12,020
You presented it better than me.

779
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:15,220
No, its proved once again
that they're fools.

780
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:18,420
Had I been the judge,
I would give the award to you.

781
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:22,120
So the award belongs to you.
Take it.

782
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:25,080
You deserve the award more.
It's yours

783
00:58:25,350 --> 00:58:26,760
Please take it.

784
00:58:26,950 --> 00:58:29,760
I've never given up anything in life
for another person.

785
00:58:29,950 --> 00:58:33,990
But there is justice in this.
You deserve it.

786
00:58:34,190 --> 00:58:36,260
Then...
- Then?

787
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:41,060
Then...take it if not I'll get upset.

788
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:43,640
Sharath, hey

789
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:45,490
Thank you

790
00:58:45,490 --> 00:58:46,720
Shall we have sugar cane juice?

791
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:51,390
I've cold.
- Cold?

792
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:52,990
Did you apply Vicks?

793
00:58:53,190 --> 00:58:54,920
There is a tablet for it.

794
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:56,390
No, let's go to the doctor.

795
00:58:56,390 --> 00:58:58,900
Sharath, I'm OK

796
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:00,900
I'm perfectly alright.

797
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:05,260
Why do you care so much about me?

798
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:07,990
That is...
- That is...

799
00:59:08,950 --> 00:59:10,720
That is...
- That is...

800
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:13,460
Please Sharath, say it!
- I mustn't get overwhelmed.

801
00:59:13,820 --> 00:59:17,390
Not much care,
just said about doctor casually.

802
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:20,220
I don't care myself...

803
00:59:27,390 --> 00:59:29,090
You held it perfectly, bro!

804
00:59:29,950 --> 00:59:31,360
If she had got hurt...

805
00:59:31,450 --> 00:59:33,290
Who this mad man is?

806
00:59:35,890 --> 00:59:37,420
What if she is hurt?

807
00:59:39,190 --> 00:59:42,040
What will you do now?

808
01:00:22,890 --> 01:00:24,340
Where are you, boys?

809
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:22,460
He's the guy!

810
01:01:24,450 --> 01:01:30,080
Where will you go now?
Hello, you were going overboard!

811
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:34,920
I still didn't do wrong,
if I do one...

812
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:37,780
All of you would die!

813
01:02:19,820 --> 01:02:27,760
No...no...- I can't tolerate
a tear or speck in my lover's eyes.

814
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:30,300
Not just I don't let even
her father beat her.

815
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:32,430
How dare you hurt her right
before my eye!

816
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:34,840
Bloody!
- Sharath

817
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:37,260
I'll take your hand!

818
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:43,830
What are you doing here?
Go to the hospital.

819
01:02:44,530 --> 01:02:49,430
You were bleeding, why were you watching
fight instead of going to hospital?

820
01:02:49,630 --> 01:02:52,660
No...
- At least take medicines properly, doctor.

821
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:54,230
Have food on time.
- OK

822
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:00,000
I adjusted my hair!

823
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:02,140
No problem.
Leave it.

824
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:06,490
Why did you ask me not
to adjust my hair?

825
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:12,190
I can see all the qualities of
ruining my life in that hair.

826
01:03:12,350 --> 01:03:12,960
How?

827
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:15,460
Not in mood now,
I'll tell next time.

828
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:17,460
Bye
- Sharath

829
01:03:19,990 --> 01:03:22,460
You're a good man.
- Is it?

830
01:03:23,020 --> 01:03:24,460
News to me, why?

831
01:03:24,990 --> 01:03:27,460
Not in mood now,
I'll tell next time.

832
01:03:27,460 --> 01:03:28,460
Bye

833
01:03:31,620 --> 01:03:34,120
I can't hold on anymore,
I must tell him tomorrow.

834
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:36,100
I must say I love you, Sharath.

835
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:37,690
I can't hold on anymore.

836
01:03:38,450 --> 01:03:41,720
Dad, I'll get ruined if I trust
your astrology.

837
01:03:42,090 --> 01:03:43,390
I must tell her tomorrow.

838
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:47,360
When will tomorrow arrive?

839
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:16,430
Should I offer flower to her?

840
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:19,290
No! I'll propose in my style.

841
01:04:22,660 --> 01:04:30,020
I got many ideas hearing you.
Let's meet and discuss again.

842
01:04:30,020 --> 01:04:30,690
Meeting?

843
01:04:30,690 --> 01:04:33,280
Don't worry! We'll sometimes meet up

844
01:04:35,020 --> 01:04:39,500
But this place is new to me.
I can't meet alone.

845
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:43,360
OK, we'll meet up sometime and talk
- OK

846
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:45,940
OK. See you. Bye
- Bye

847
01:04:49,390 --> 01:04:51,660
Hey boy! Come here.

848
01:04:54,060 --> 01:04:55,130
Tell me.

849
01:04:55,630 --> 01:04:59,430
You were talking to her so closely,
what were you talking about?

850
01:04:59,690 --> 01:05:02,430
Why do you want to know?
- Right.

851
01:05:03,330 --> 01:05:04,290
Why?

852
01:05:04,590 --> 01:05:07,030
You know there's something
between us, right?

853
01:05:07,230 --> 01:05:11,430
If you enter central and park with side stand, I feel
 like someone is pricking my heart with a pin.

854
01:05:13,090 --> 01:05:14,590
Try to understand me!

855
01:05:15,230 --> 01:05:17,930
She was talking to me,
what bothers you?

856
01:05:19,460 --> 01:05:21,030
After you said this,

857
01:05:21,230 --> 01:05:24,600
you must maintain at least
100 meters away from her.

858
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:26,960
If I see you near her...get lost!

859
01:05:29,490 --> 01:05:31,220
Stay distant if 2 people
are in love,

860
01:05:31,220 --> 01:05:34,290
if you try to get between them...

861
01:05:38,660 --> 01:05:40,060
Spoiled my mood!

862
01:05:42,290 --> 01:05:45,990
Why Sharath hasn't come today also?
Shall I call him on phone?

863
01:05:46,990 --> 01:05:48,160
Why should I call him?

864
01:05:50,490 --> 01:05:54,660
Your Romeo has proved that he is mental.

865
01:05:54,990 --> 01:05:56,090
Why? What happened?

866
01:05:56,650 --> 01:05:58,520
Were you talking with Sandeep?

867
01:05:58,620 --> 01:06:01,860
Yes, he was saying something
and I was listening to him.

868
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:07,030
Watching this he beat up Sandeep.

869
01:06:07,220 --> 01:06:09,460
Not only that he has warned him too.

870
01:06:09,650 --> 01:06:12,240
It seems he must stay at least
100 meters away from you.

871
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:16,180
Poor man! Sandeep himself told me this.
- Is it?

872
01:06:16,460 --> 01:06:21,230
Yes, Swathi.
That's why I told you not to love him.

873
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:26,200
If he suspects you so much now,
I don't want to tell anything else.

874
01:06:26,390 --> 01:06:27,190
Your wish.

875
01:06:27,890 --> 01:06:29,790
I didn't get selected for the final,

876
01:06:29,990 --> 01:06:32,390
you're intelligent
and you got selected.

877
01:06:32,590 --> 01:06:36,460
Concentrate on your project,
you can think about this later.

878
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:37,530
No Madhu...

879
01:06:37,730 --> 01:06:42,600
Go to your room,
I've to run an errand.

880
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:47,790
Why did Sharath behave like this?

881
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:54,560
Everyone going towards airport
isn't a flight passenger, right?

882
01:06:55,460 --> 01:07:00,160
Isn't it wrong to think he was
flirting just for talking to her?

883
01:07:01,860 --> 01:07:05,560
Anyway it was good to beat that idiot.

884
01:07:05,790 --> 01:07:09,560
If he had any such intention,
he would give up now.

885
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:16,160
I'm not prepared for girls.

886
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:17,330
I must prepare now for the final round.

887
01:07:25,140 --> 01:07:29,430
Swathi had met with an accident.
- What? Accident?

888
01:07:31,790 --> 01:07:33,460
Swathi...accident patient.
- 1 sec.

889
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,020
1st floor, 3rd room
- Thank you

890
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:43,880
Please get up!
- Thanks

891
01:07:45,620 --> 01:07:49,760
I thought you'd have lost limbs
in the accident.

892
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:52,690
But it was a very small accident.

893
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:56,360
Take rest, final round is near.

894
01:07:56,420 --> 01:07:57,690
Yes...yes...

895
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:01,140
Sharath?!

896
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:03,180
Sharath, that is...
- What's wrong with you, Sharath?

897
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:04,420
What did I tell you?

898
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:06,760
Didn't I warn you to stay away from her?

899
01:08:07,740 --> 01:08:08,760
Didn't I tell you?

900
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:10,220
Sharath please

901
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:11,420
Can't you understand
if I tell you once?

902
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:13,260
Do you've to stick on to her always?

903
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:16,490
Leave him, Sharath
- I'll kill you today!

904
01:08:17,740 --> 01:08:19,920
Stop it, Sharath. What happened to you?

905
01:08:24,590 --> 01:08:28,730
Did I get slapped by you?
That too for him!

906
01:08:31,790 --> 01:08:34,790
What happened to me?
How was I?

907
01:08:34,990 --> 01:08:37,000
You needed this!
Why did you beat him?

908
01:08:37,090 --> 01:08:39,560
What was his mistake?
He was helping me to sit up.

909
01:08:40,610 --> 01:08:45,040
You're behaving like a savage.
Aren't you ashamed?

910
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:45,920
Stop it.

911
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:50,720
Not me, you must be ashamed of it.

912
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:53,240
Because you're behaving
like a bitch.

913
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:56,790
I mistook you to be a good girl.

914
01:08:56,950 --> 01:08:58,720
You too are like all other girls.

915
01:08:59,420 --> 01:09:01,790
Touching him physically...

916
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:05,020
I...a girl like you...

917
01:09:06,860 --> 01:09:10,460
I knew about girls
but still got cheated.

918
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:14,480
I came to tell you something.

919
01:09:14,620 --> 01:09:15,920
Good, I didn't tell you.

920
01:09:20,490 --> 01:09:24,740
You gave me something, right?
- Sharath

921
01:09:49,240 --> 01:09:51,470
I must forget her totally.

922
01:09:54,130 --> 01:09:57,100
What happened to you, Swathi?
Where are you going?

923
01:09:57,130 --> 01:09:58,700
I'm going to native, Madhu.

924
01:09:59,220 --> 01:10:00,780
I can't stay in a place

Young Global leader of
Indian origin Sharath,

941
01:12:24,790 --> 01:12:33,500
has been chosen to represent India in
economic and business implementation forum.

942
01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:13,380
Hi Swathi
How are you?

943
01:13:13,410 --> 01:13:14,910
I'm fine.
How are you?

944
01:13:14,990 --> 01:13:15,860
I'm fine too.

945
01:13:16,050 --> 01:13:18,190
I've good news for you.
- What?

946
01:13:18,580 --> 01:13:20,210
I'm getting married
on 28th of next month.

947
01:13:20,340 --> 01:13:22,120
Don't miss it, you must make it.
- Oh my god

948
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:25,240
Congratulations. I'll surely make it.
Of course I'll be there.

949
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:27,580
Thank you Swathi.

950
01:13:27,860 --> 01:13:34,090
Why not forget him and
start new life?

951
01:13:36,190 --> 01:13:43,190
I don't think about him,
I've forgotten him for 2 years now.

952
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:22,540
Hello
- Hello Sharath. How are you, son?

953
01:14:22,540 --> 01:14:23,590
Fine

954
01:14:24,190 --> 01:14:26,060
But...
- But?

955
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:28,720
Tell me, son.
What's the matter?

956
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:32,060
I made a grave mistake
in Swathi's matter.

957
01:14:32,590 --> 01:14:37,790
I became selfish that she must talk
and move close with me only, dad.

958
01:14:40,020 --> 01:14:43,120
Dad, I shouldn't have slapped her.

959
01:14:43,660 --> 01:14:44,790
In a fit of rage I did it.

960
01:14:46,050 --> 01:14:47,060
It was my mistake.

961
01:14:47,890 --> 01:14:49,290
It was my mistake, right dad?

962
01:14:50,090 --> 01:14:51,760
Let bygones be bygones,

963
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:54,560
forget everything and
come back to India.

964
01:14:54,750 --> 01:14:56,090
Start a new life here.

965
01:14:56,290 --> 01:15:00,490
I can't dad...
it was my first love, dad.

966
01:15:00,690 --> 01:15:02,800
I'm unable to forget her, dad.

OK, I'll inform to boss. Excuse me, sir.
- Yeah

977
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:30,100
Sorry sir. The meeting you just fixed today
has been postponed to 17th of this month.

978
01:16:30,100 --> 01:16:32,100
I mean the day
 after tomorrow.

979
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:33,560
That's something...

980
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:37,380
Then today is 15th March
- Yes, sir.

981
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,330
Today is Swathi's birthday!

982
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:46,230
Shall I wish her?

983
01:16:59,330 --> 01:17:01,330
Hello

984
01:17:01,330 --> 01:17:04,120
Who is it?
- Sharath

985
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:18,800
Which Sharath?

986
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:24,060
Sharath

987
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:28,300
Tell me!

988
01:17:28,460 --> 01:17:32,540
Happy Birthday, Swathi
- Thank you

989
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:35,300
How are you, doctor?

990
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:44,700
Fear of losing you...
jealousy...love...

991
01:17:44,890 --> 01:17:46,200
It forced me to slap you.

992
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:55,580
I love you, Swathi.

993
01:17:57,200 --> 01:18:00,670
I've been regretting every moment
after slapping you.

994
01:18:01,540 --> 01:18:05,100
I really love you. I'm unable
 to live without you, Swathi.

995
01:18:05,430 --> 01:18:09,600
It was my mistake. Please try to understand
me. I just can't live without you.

996
01:18:23,130 --> 01:18:26,600
Sharath, I never had any
such feelings for you.

997
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:30,460
I'm getting engaged.

998
01:18:31,230 --> 01:18:32,630
Please don't ever call me again.

999
01:18:32,630 --> 01:18:34,630
Thank you

1000
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:36,100
OK

1001
01:19:04,130 --> 01:19:06,130
I love you, Sharath.

1002
01:19:06,130 --> 01:19:08,600
I don't want to lose you at any cost.

1003
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:10,600
I love you

1004
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:26,860
It seems somebody beat leading
industrialist Sharath in Mangalore.

1005
01:19:26,930 --> 01:19:30,500
Why are you selling
evening paper in early morning?

1006
01:19:30,830 --> 01:19:33,460
Murderous attack on
leading industrialist Sharath!

1007
01:19:34,060 --> 01:19:34,920
Who could've done it?

1008
01:19:35,060 --> 01:19:37,420
Leading industrialist Sharath has
been assaulted in Mangalore.

1009
01:19:37,620 --> 01:19:40,180
He went to Mangalore to attend
a friend's wedding...

1010
01:19:40,180 --> 01:19:42,150
Leading industrialist Sharath...

1011
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:45,920
Leading industrialist and
global young leader Sharath,

1012
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:48,530
was attacked and
assaulted by rowdies.

1013
01:19:49,290 --> 01:19:52,560
He was coming back from Mangalore
after attending a friend's marriage,

1014
01:19:52,750 --> 01:19:54,060
this murderous attack took place!

1015
01:19:54,100 --> 01:19:57,360
Reason for the
 attack is unknown.

1016
01:19:58,140 --> 01:19:59,510
Look at this!
- Police are investigating.

1017
01:19:59,710 --> 01:20:03,880
Sharath has been admitted in
a prestigious medical hospital.

1018
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:08,810
Press reporter Ravi Joshi has
succeeded in saving Sharath's life.

1019
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:12,640
Ravi Joshi is talking to our reporter...

1020
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:17,400
Can you please give us complete
details about this incident?

1021
01:20:17,670 --> 01:20:19,110
What happened madam?

1022
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:21,110
I feel dizzy.

1023
01:20:21,310 --> 01:20:22,440
Come, take rest.

1024
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:25,370
Don't worry about him.

1025
01:20:26,860 --> 01:20:29,920
Come...come...you're a doctor,
you must take care of yourself.

1026
01:20:31,830 --> 01:20:33,430
Sister, get glucose ready.

1027
01:20:33,690 --> 01:20:34,430
Slowly...

1028
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:39,470
He may regain consciousness
anytime now, doctor.

1029
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:42,260
Take care of him.

1030
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:06,530
Murderous attack on industrialist Sharath.

1031
01:21:08,190 --> 01:21:10,530
While returning from Mangalore after
attending a friend's wedding.

1032
01:21:10,730 --> 01:21:12,080
this incident took place.

1033
01:21:12,130 --> 01:21:14,100
He was with his future wife Swathi...

1034
01:21:14,100 --> 01:21:16,160
Has Swathi agreed to marry me?

1035
01:21:20,130 --> 01:21:23,840
She donated blood to you, she was
awake all night to look after you.

1036
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:26,200
She is taking rest now.
- Can I see her?

1037
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:29,320
You can't in this condition, sir.
- I must see her!

1038
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:32,160
You mustn't do like this.

1039
01:21:33,230 --> 01:21:34,500
I must see Swathi.

1040
01:21:35,300 --> 01:21:37,760
I'm fine, I must see Swathi.

1041
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:40,700
Please don't strain yourself.

1042
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:50,230
Don't strain yourself...slow...

1043
01:21:57,800 --> 01:22:00,600
She's fine.
Just rest will help her.

1044
01:22:02,360 --> 01:22:03,260
You go out.

1045
01:22:04,460 --> 01:22:05,330
You take rest.

1046
01:22:05,530 --> 01:22:06,720
You've strained yourself.

1047
01:22:08,660 --> 01:22:11,060
No sir, media people are
waiting outside.

1048
01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:13,230
Okay, sir.

1049
01:22:14,130 --> 01:22:17,060
We'll wait outside.
Come, let's go out.

1050
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:07,530
I never had any such feelings for you.

1051
01:23:09,790 --> 01:23:11,260
I'm getting engaged.

1052
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:13,360
Don't ever call me again.

1053
01:23:22,660 --> 01:23:24,260
Mother, I'm coming to India.

1054
01:23:28,290 --> 01:23:31,260
Leading industrialist Sharath
has come to India.

1055
01:23:31,460 --> 01:23:34,730
People are curious about
his sudden visit to India.

1056
01:23:34,930 --> 01:23:36,430
Are you here with any new plan, sir?

1057
01:23:36,430 --> 01:23:39,440
This is purely personal visit, that's it.

1058
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:42,680
About other plans, not now,
I'll talk to you later.

1059
01:23:43,210 --> 01:23:44,680
Allow me to go home.

1060
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:40,930
I'm home!

1061
01:24:42,330 --> 01:24:43,560
Wait a minute!

1062
01:24:47,240 --> 01:24:48,260
Over.

1063
01:24:51,980 --> 01:24:53,280
May God bless you long life!

1064
01:24:55,330 --> 01:24:56,900
He hasn't forgotten it yet.

1065
01:24:57,590 --> 01:24:59,030
Come quickly, mom.
- I will come.

1066
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,260
What else, dad?

1067
01:25:13,460 --> 01:25:15,230
Is your BP and sugar under control?

1068
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:18,400
Mom, don't serve oily food to dad.

1069
01:25:18,590 --> 01:25:21,880
Both of you take care of your health.
Both are aged, I'm saying.

1070
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:25,370
Your dad's BP and sugar can't
get controlled with food.

1071
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:27,300
Is it? Why, dad?

1072
01:25:27,500 --> 01:25:30,040
Has any new planet entered your life?

1073
01:25:30,130 --> 01:25:32,860
Planets are...
- Enough of joke, Sharath.

1074
01:25:32,860 --> 01:25:36,760
You got fame and fortune!
But what is the use?

1075
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:41,970
You still think about Swathi and
we know the pain you're going through.

1076
01:25:42,260 --> 01:25:44,730
I don't like to see my son sad.

1077
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:48,730
Please son, get married soon.
I'll find you a good girl.

1078
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:53,500
Your dad had 2 mild heart attacks.

1079
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:01,800
You keep quiet.

1080
01:26:01,990 --> 01:26:04,830
How long can we keep quiet
with pain in heart?

1081
01:26:05,030 --> 01:26:08,400
We've everything but no peace of mind.

1082
01:26:08,620 --> 01:26:13,890
Look Sharath. Though we're
 seeing you after 2 years,

1083
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:16,550
you still look like
college student to us,

1084
01:26:16,750 --> 01:26:21,020
but without our knowledge or yours,
you've changed a lot.

1085
01:26:21,420 --> 01:26:23,550
Change is circle of life!

1086
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:26,880
Swathi too would've
changed like you.

1087
01:26:27,080 --> 01:26:30,820
So, forget her and
accept your mother's choice.

1088
01:26:31,850 --> 01:26:34,020
Everyone would be fine.

1089
01:26:34,360 --> 01:26:36,780
Father, I...

1090
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:38,500
One more thing.

1091
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:42,520
It isn't my intention that your mother
needs a daughter-in-law to look after her,

1092
01:26:42,720 --> 01:26:44,740
for your future, for your life,

1093
01:26:44,780 --> 01:26:47,580
it must have a meaning,
that's our only intention!

1094
01:26:49,530 --> 01:26:52,330
Please listen to your mother
and agree to marry.

1095
01:26:54,900 --> 01:26:56,430
He won't
 listen to us.

1096
01:26:56,630 --> 01:26:59,600
I can understand
 your worry.

1097
01:26:59,900 --> 01:27:02,500
But this is not an issue
to force him.

1098
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:12,880
Okay mother!
I'll marry the girl you select.

1099
01:27:12,900 --> 01:27:13,860
Are you
 happy now?

1100
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:18,930
Watch out! We'll find the
most beautiful girl for you!

1101
01:27:20,230 --> 01:27:21,660
Thank God, he agreed.

1102
01:27:33,330 --> 01:27:34,620
Shall I take
 leave, mom?

1103
01:27:35,300 --> 01:27:36,830
Take blessing, son.

1104
01:27:39,330 --> 01:27:41,900
May you be blessed with success.
Have a pleasant journey, son.

1105
01:27:42,900 --> 01:27:43,730
Call dad.

1106
01:27:50,060 --> 01:27:52,660
Cancel the flight,
 I'll go by road.

1107
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:54,140
No need, I'll go alone.

1108
01:27:54,330 --> 01:27:55,330
I've arranged it, sir.

1109
01:27:55,530 --> 01:27:56,960
I told you, right?

1110
01:27:58,500 --> 01:28:00,100
Mom, bye.

1111
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:03,030
Dad! Shall I take leave?
- Have a safe journey!

1112
01:28:30,900 --> 01:28:32,180
Kind India, Bangalore!

1113
01:28:32,180 --> 01:28:35,140
It's been years since
I listened to it.

1114
01:28:35,140 --> 01:28:36,780
...has been honored
 with doctorate degree.

1115
01:28:36,970 --> 01:28:39,410
Fans all over state are celebrating it.

1116
01:28:39,770 --> 01:28:44,450
Lorries and buses were off the road
protesting against the petrol hike.

1117
01:28:44,810 --> 01:28:51,850
Common people were affected by it.

1118
01:28:52,100 --> 01:28:56,640
Our govt....our people...great!

1119
01:29:14,070 --> 01:29:14,840
Leave me!

1120
01:29:17,170 --> 01:29:20,640
Please...please leave her...
- Go away!

1121
01:29:20,840 --> 01:29:22,940
Hey, start the car!

1122
01:29:23,170 --> 01:29:25,600
We'll taste Karnataka fish today!

1123
01:29:31,170 --> 01:29:34,040
Bloody idiots! Is it Assam?

1124
01:29:34,040 --> 01:29:35,180
Karnataka!

1125
01:29:35,530 --> 01:29:38,320
We don't spare if you touch
stone, earth or water!

1126
01:29:38,470 --> 01:29:42,410
If you dare touch a girl right before
our eyes, would we spare you?

1127
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:46,140
Get him, don't leave him.

1128
01:30:26,440 --> 01:30:27,570
Leave...leave me...

1129
01:31:39,320 --> 01:31:41,920
People of Karnataka are famous
for ripping out nerves!

1130
01:31:42,120 --> 01:31:44,960
Find and gather yours and
leave the place.

1131
01:31:45,150 --> 01:31:46,220
Leave!

1132
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:56,360
Thank you
very much, sir.

1133
01:31:57,220 --> 01:32:01,360
When you love a girl,
you're her body guard!

1134
01:32:01,620 --> 01:32:04,280
Along with loving a girl
like our Crazy star,

1135
01:32:04,320 --> 01:32:06,800
we must learn Karate
like Karate king!

1136
01:32:09,820 --> 01:32:12,890
All boys in love must learn Karate!

1137
01:32:13,090 --> 01:32:15,960
I think your lover is very lucky.

1138
01:32:20,420 --> 01:32:21,050
Go!

1139
01:32:21,080 --> 01:32:22,050
Thanks brother.

1140
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:33,070
For saving his lover, he hit
my heart by bringing up my love.

1141
01:32:37,300 --> 01:32:40,700
I'll forget Swathi by the time
I come back mom Narayana's marriage.

1142
01:32:49,700 --> 01:32:52,020
Should the bus
 break down now?

1143
01:32:52,110 --> 01:32:55,340
Standing in rain!
My damn fate!

1144
01:32:55,700 --> 01:32:58,040
Some car is coming,
please stop...stop...

1145
01:32:58,240 --> 01:32:59,440
Stop the car please.

1146
01:32:59,940 --> 01:33:03,040
Looks like God has sent a car,
Come...Come...

1147
01:33:03,700 --> 01:33:05,910
Please open the dickey, son.

1148
01:33:06,110 --> 01:33:08,070
She'll keep her luggage.

1149
01:33:12,070 --> 01:33:12,940
Shall I start, granny?

1150
01:33:34,900 --> 01:33:41,340
What's this, son? You stopped
the car promising to give lift.

1151
01:33:41,360 --> 01:33:43,420
Look, I've urgent work.

1152
01:33:43,420 --> 01:33:47,640
The man marrying my grand daughter
would be waiting for me.

1153
01:33:47,700 --> 01:33:52,200
Because I've the sacred thread with me.
I must take it to them.

1154
01:33:52,200 --> 01:33:53,810
Go fast, son!

1155
01:34:00,240 --> 01:34:05,240
You look quite familiar.
- Do I? Where?

1156
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:08,110
Are you TV actor?

1157
01:34:08,310 --> 01:34:10,820
I used to...
but not now.

1158
01:34:10,970 --> 01:34:14,570
That's why I don't see
you now on TV.

1159
01:34:14,940 --> 01:34:21,280
Why are you driving it like a cart?
Go fast!

1160
01:34:21,470 --> 01:34:24,370
I've herbal medicine
 to charge up!

1161
01:34:24,570 --> 01:34:28,540
Shall I give to make you drive
at jet speed?

1162
01:34:28,610 --> 01:34:30,570
No, please.

1163
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:35,220
Where are you all going?

1164
01:34:35,270 --> 01:34:41,040
Not all but we 3 are
going to Haale Beluru.

1165
01:34:41,240 --> 01:34:43,440
She is going to Mangalore.

1166
01:34:44,670 --> 01:34:47,170
I'm also going to Mangalore.

1167
01:34:48,070 --> 01:34:50,140
I'll drop you in your place and go.

1168
01:34:50,470 --> 01:34:54,880
Goddess Belruamma, in this rain,
with buses on strike,

1169
01:34:55,070 --> 01:34:59,140
you've saved us, mother!
I'm grateful to you!

1170
01:34:59,160 --> 01:35:01,580
Are you going alone in this car?

1171
01:35:01,600 --> 01:35:04,310
What to do? I'm alone.
- Is it?

1172
01:35:04,410 --> 01:35:07,370
Marry as quickly as possible.

1173
01:35:07,570 --> 01:35:11,020
This car doesn't look good
with lone passenger.

1174
01:35:11,110 --> 01:35:13,840
It looks good if you go
as a couple.

1175
01:35:14,040 --> 01:35:20,940
My husband took me on bike
when we were married.

1176
01:35:21,140 --> 01:35:23,680
Do you know how happy I was then...

1177
01:35:23,870 --> 01:35:27,740
Granny... Rain has stopped but not your talk.

1178
01:35:27,740 --> 01:35:29,070
Please come quietly, granny.

1179
01:35:29,070 --> 01:35:32,570
You don't like me talking, leave it.

1180
01:35:34,240 --> 01:35:36,880
We've reached my place,
please stop the car.

1181
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:37,000
Haale Beluru

1182
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:38,540
Stop...stop...
- Yes.
Haale Beluru

1183
01:35:38,540 --> 01:35:38,740
Haale Beluru

1184
01:35:38,740 --> 01:35:39,580
Do you see the board?
That's the place.
Haale Beluru

1185
01:35:39,580 --> 01:35:40,570
Do you see the board?
That's the place.

1186
01:35:40,770 --> 01:35:42,810
Get down quickly.

1187
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,570
You said she was going to Mangalore, granny.

1188
01:35:45,570 --> 01:35:47,870
Why did she got down?

1189
01:35:48,040 --> 01:35:50,240
Why did you get down?

1190
01:35:50,390 --> 01:35:52,720
You could've traveled
to Mangalore, right?

1191
01:35:53,040 --> 01:35:55,480
No need, granny.
I'll manage myself.

1192
01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:59,680
You're alone,
where will you do, dear?

1193
01:35:59,970 --> 01:36:01,940
He appears like a good boy.

1194
01:36:02,140 --> 01:36:04,610
I don't think he would rape you.

1195
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:09,430
If by any chance he rape you,
marry him immediately.

1196
01:36:09,620 --> 01:36:13,620
If he refuse,
threaten to file case going to DD9.

1197
01:36:13,790 --> 01:36:14,520
Oh god!

1198
01:36:14,720 --> 01:36:18,560
He would marry you in fear.

1199
01:36:18,740 --> 01:36:23,140
Good boy.
You can't find such good boys.

1200
01:36:23,220 --> 01:36:26,690
No, granny...that is...
not like that...

1201
01:36:27,310 --> 01:36:31,940
Nothing to it, transport men are
 on strike, useless buggers!

1202
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,740
Come with me, listen to me.
- Granny, listen to me.

1203
01:36:34,890 --> 01:36:37,020
You listen to me.

1204
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:40,690
You'll go to Mangalore safely.
I'll stand guarantee for it.

1205
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:46,310
Bring it down!

1206
01:36:48,200 --> 01:36:50,010
What is it, granny?
- What?

1207
01:36:50,200 --> 01:36:56,210
Take her to Mangalore safely,

1208
01:36:56,400 --> 01:37:01,110
if you get any crazy ideas,

1209
01:37:01,310 --> 01:37:07,110
she knows Karate, be careful!
Go...go...

1210
01:37:17,270 --> 01:37:20,120
I don't think she will talk to me.
Let me ask her.

1211
01:37:20,140 --> 01:37:23,140
 ♪ You've come like
 the light of my life ♪

1212
01:37:23,340 --> 01:37:26,610
 ♪ You've come like

1213
01:37:26,970 --> 01:37:28,570
Will you please
 switch off the radio?

1214
01:37:30,860 --> 01:37:32,940
Let it play, song is matching
the situation.

1215
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:45,170
Hearts of boys and
dog's tail are same,

1216
01:37:45,370 --> 01:37:51,380
though tied with a stick,
on seeing a girl, it turns crooked.

1217
01:37:52,090 --> 01:37:54,190
Just a while ago
I made a resolution.

1218
01:37:54,390 --> 01:37:56,260
To forget you completely.

1219
01:37:56,310 --> 01:37:58,040
My bad luck I found you.

1220
01:37:58,490 --> 01:38:00,120
You won't live long.

1221
01:38:02,900 --> 01:38:04,610
Again the same...

1222
01:38:07,610 --> 01:38:09,040
How are you, doctor?.

1223
01:38:11,770 --> 01:38:12,570
Fine.

1224
01:38:12,570 --> 01:38:14,310
How did your
engagement go?

1225
01:38:15,500 --> 01:38:16,470
Whose engagement?

1226
01:38:19,930 --> 01:38:21,260
Your engagement!

1227
01:38:21,490 --> 01:38:23,330
You said your
 marriage is fixed.

1228
01:38:25,430 --> 01:38:27,660
I'll go to Mangalore on my own,
you carry on.

1229
01:38:29,460 --> 01:38:32,590
Hello...hello...doctor!

1230
01:38:32,970 --> 01:38:34,940
So, she's not engaged.

1231
01:38:35,100 --> 01:38:38,190
Is engagement canceled
or not engaged at all.

1232
01:38:38,390 --> 01:38:40,590
Hello doctor!

1233
01:38:41,140 --> 01:38:43,540
Your luggage!

1234
01:38:47,340 --> 01:38:48,720
Love Spin

1235
01:38:52,040 --> 01:38:54,480
Nothing happened yet.

1236
01:38:54,920 --> 01:38:55,860
Open the dickey.

1237
01:38:56,060 --> 01:38:57,890
You didn't tell me about
 your engagement.

1238
01:38:58,090 --> 01:39:00,360
Open the dickey.

1239
01:39:02,440 --> 01:39:04,070
Has your engagement
got...?

1240
01:39:04,860 --> 01:39:07,290
I don't want
 to talk about it.

1241
01:39:07,380 --> 01:39:10,080
I'll go to Mangalore on my own,
you carry on.

1242
01:39:10,080 --> 01:39:11,250
Love Spin

1243
01:39:11,250 --> 01:39:15,750
I can go but it's crime according to
boys' rules to leave girl midway.

1244
01:39:16,910 --> 01:39:20,710
Look, transport men are on strike.
You won't get bus.

1245
01:39:21,410 --> 01:39:23,380
I'm also going to Mangalore,
come with me.

1246
01:39:23,950 --> 01:39:26,690
Just because I'm going to Mangalore,
you don't have to go there only.

1247
01:39:26,780 --> 01:39:28,980
Mind your own business.
Don't behave silly.

1248
01:39:29,170 --> 01:39:32,610
I needed this.
Wait a minute.

1249
01:39:34,280 --> 01:39:41,150
Don't get intimate with new girl
and don't help a girl you know.

1250
01:39:41,450 --> 01:39:44,640
Look at this invitation, I'm going to Mangalore
to my friend's marriage.

1251
01:39:45,580 --> 01:39:46,790
Are you going to this marriage?

1252
01:39:47,620 --> 01:39:49,720
Did Madhu invite you?
How?

1253
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:51,850
Madhu? Which Madhu?

1254
01:39:52,220 --> 01:39:54,000
I'm going to my friend
 Narayana's marriage.

1255
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
Narayana....Madhu...

1256
01:39:58,140 --> 01:39:59,820
I'm also going to the
 same marriage.

1257
01:39:59,940 --> 01:40:03,640
Oh God!
 What a divine play!

1258
01:40:03,730 --> 01:40:06,630
I wanted to forget
but you brought her before me.

1259
01:40:06,720 --> 01:40:09,320
You made her miss the bus
by creating transport strike.

1260
01:40:09,540 --> 01:40:12,180
You've made us both attend
the same marriage.

1261
01:40:12,260 --> 01:40:18,760
Seeing all this I think
we'll marry and have children. Isn't it?

1262
01:40:19,860 --> 01:40:21,530
Nothing, leave it.

1263
01:40:22,390 --> 01:40:27,260
Come, I'd do the same even if
granny was in your place.

1264
01:40:27,540 --> 01:40:28,890
I'll come.

1265
01:40:29,490 --> 01:40:32,290
But we both are strangers there.

1266
01:40:32,380 --> 01:40:33,310
Same dialogue.

1267
01:40:42,890 --> 01:40:46,320
I'm a master of 'Love Spin'!
A 'Love Spin' for me!

1268
01:40:47,260 --> 01:40:51,470
Swathi, understand me and
come into my life,

1269
01:40:51,770 --> 01:40:58,680
then, you can sit like queen and I'll be your
 driver, and we can go on long drive non-stop.

You come to ward off evil,
you come forward to take photos.

1307
01:45:04,200 --> 01:45:06,840
My friend has come mom abroad
for my marriage.

1308
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:08,880
I told you not to disturb him, right?

1309
01:45:08,950 --> 01:45:10,720
Come, ward of evil eye cast on him.

1310
01:45:10,920 --> 01:45:14,160
Take video,
I've paid you well, right?

1311
01:45:14,760 --> 01:45:16,890
Do you know how happy I'm
because you've come?

1312
01:45:17,090 --> 01:45:19,320
I'm not the groom, it's you!

1313
01:45:20,580 --> 01:45:24,050
You too will get married soon.
Don't worry.

1314
01:45:24,200 --> 01:45:25,840
Do you say like that?
Let me see, come.

1315
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:28,050
Freshen up in 5 minutes.
- Please give him way.

1316
01:45:28,420 --> 01:45:32,540
You go, he'll be here only,
you carry on. Come.

1317
01:45:32,560 --> 01:45:35,840
No need of this extra arrangement.

1318
01:45:35,920 --> 01:45:37,960
Let me be simple as usual.

1319
01:45:38,160 --> 01:45:42,130
I'm fortunate that you've come to
my marriage, thank you, friend.

1320
01:45:42,440 --> 01:45:44,210
Not you, I must thank you.

1321
01:45:44,290 --> 01:45:46,590
Looks like your marriage will
become a turning point in my life.

1322
01:45:46,620 --> 01:45:47,740
Turning point?

1323
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:48,920
Come, I'll tell you.
- Come.

1324
01:45:49,020 --> 01:45:53,020
Did he propose again in car
and troubled you?

1325
01:45:53,220 --> 01:45:57,090
No, he called me on my birthday
and proposed to me,

1326
01:45:58,060 --> 01:46:02,260
but I avoided him by lying
that I'm getting engaged.

1327
01:46:02,920 --> 01:46:06,820
But I feel he has
 changed a lot.

1328
01:46:07,450 --> 01:46:11,490
Why? What has happened
 to you again?

1329
01:46:12,150 --> 01:46:14,020
What did he tell you?
What did he do with you?

1330
01:46:14,220 --> 01:46:15,920
Think about it again.

1331
01:46:17,820 --> 01:46:19,880
First I must take my husband
to task.

1332
01:46:20,220 --> 01:46:22,720
How did he befriend Sharath?

1333
01:46:23,280 --> 01:46:27,080
I'll take a special class
on our first night.

1334
01:46:27,480 --> 01:46:28,260
Come, friend.

1335
01:46:28,300 --> 01:46:31,550
If you eat food of my region,
you'll forget everything else.

1336
01:46:31,980 --> 01:46:35,660
Why are you going there?
- To eat.

1337
01:46:35,710 --> 01:46:38,680
That's not for you.
This special seat is for you.

1338
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:44,540
Would anyone sit there to eat?
Keep quiet, buddy.

1339
01:46:44,610 --> 01:46:47,620
Friend, I arranged it specially for you.
- For God's sake, will you keep quiet?

1340
01:46:49,310 --> 01:46:52,540
Though you're famous,
you're still down to earth.

1341
01:46:53,080 --> 01:46:54,080
Okay, go.

1342
01:46:54,280 --> 01:46:55,780
I'll be back in a minute, friend.

1343
01:46:55,810 --> 01:46:59,550
Eat well, I'll not get
married again in life.

1344
01:46:59,750 --> 01:47:03,620
I'm very happy to sit with you
and have food.

1345
01:47:07,350 --> 01:47:08,980
Should there be a vacant
chair only next to him?

1346
01:47:08,980 --> 01:47:10,220
Full filmy style!

1347
01:47:21,200 --> 01:47:23,530
Why?
- For dropping me here.

1348
01:47:24,330 --> 01:47:27,530
I've done nothing,
it was an act of god.

1349
01:47:29,160 --> 01:47:30,880
How come you're
sitting next to me?

1350
01:47:30,920 --> 01:47:33,520
Chair was vacant,
 so I sat.

1351
01:47:33,570 --> 01:47:36,200
My heart too is vacant for
the past 2 years.

1352
01:47:38,930 --> 01:47:41,730
I never desired to meet
but met you.

1353
01:47:42,160 --> 01:47:44,430
We're in a marriage house.
Under the canopy!

1354
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:47,000
I can hear marriage band too distantly.

1355
01:47:47,190 --> 01:47:48,530
Banana leaves are
adorning the entrance.

1356
01:47:48,890 --> 01:47:50,760
Only bridal
 dress is missing.

1357
01:47:50,960 --> 01:47:51,860
Isn't it?.

1358
01:47:55,600 --> 01:47:56,200
Love Spin

1359
01:47:56,200 --> 01:47:56,600
Time isn't good.
Love Spin

1360
01:47:56,600 --> 01:47:57,670
Time isn't good.

1361
01:47:59,300 --> 01:48:05,040
You're great batsman Sharath, right?
- Batsman?

1362
01:48:05,050 --> 01:48:05,920
Yes.

1363
01:48:06,110 --> 01:48:07,440
In a way I'm
 a batsman.

1364
01:48:07,460 --> 01:48:10,680
I've seen you everyday on TV.

1365
01:48:10,740 --> 01:48:12,680
I and my daughter
 see you.

1366
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:16,180
My daughter loves
 you so much.

1367
01:48:16,380 --> 01:48:18,560
Do you know that
she kiss you in TV?

1368
01:48:18,750 --> 01:48:21,350
Did you see me batting on TV?

1369
01:48:21,380 --> 01:48:23,050
I didn't play cricket
 in recent past.

1370
01:48:23,110 --> 01:48:26,160
I've seen you play
 on TV everyday.

1371
01:48:26,310 --> 01:48:28,120
That you're a
 great batsman.

1372
01:48:28,120 --> 01:48:30,790
Aunt, that's businessman
 not batsman.

1373
01:48:31,220 --> 01:48:34,890
Oh businessman?

1374
01:48:37,300 --> 01:48:40,180
I want a shot
 with you.

1375
01:48:41,170 --> 01:48:44,770
I mean a photo!
- Photo?

1376
01:48:44,980 --> 01:48:47,460
I can't see a photographer here.
Where's he?

1377
01:48:53,900 --> 01:48:57,760
I'll take one.
- You're wanted here, Musthafa.

1378
01:48:59,300 --> 01:49:01,360
One minute,
I'll take one snap.

1379
01:49:04,360 --> 01:49:05,600
Is it my girl?

1380
01:49:06,890 --> 01:49:08,260
Done.

1381
01:49:10,690 --> 01:49:13,100
Is it you, Musthafa?

1382
01:49:13,930 --> 01:49:15,930
Take my snap
with him.

1383
01:49:16,300 --> 01:49:17,030
Come.

1384
01:49:19,390 --> 01:49:20,830
Please sit.
- I'll come now.

1385
01:49:21,030 --> 01:49:23,200
Please sit...hello...

1386
01:49:23,390 --> 01:49:25,760
One minute.
- I'll come back.

1387
01:49:25,930 --> 01:49:27,260
Who is she? Too much!

1388
01:49:27,260 --> 01:49:30,030
Have you gone so far?
I'll not spare him.

1389
01:49:32,160 --> 01:49:35,330
You're a famous man.
VIP too!

1390
01:49:35,530 --> 01:49:40,200
Though you're great, why are you hitting
hard on my stomach and my heart?

1391
01:49:40,390 --> 01:49:41,480
What did I do?

1392
01:49:41,530 --> 01:49:42,900
What did you do?

1393
01:49:43,090 --> 01:49:47,440
The lady with whom you took the snap,
she's my ex-lover.

1394
01:49:48,320 --> 01:49:49,400
Is it?

1395
01:49:49,590 --> 01:49:53,330
I bought her so many goodies
as young lover,

1396
01:49:53,530 --> 01:49:55,960
that I ran up ₹ 10,000 in debt
in those days,

1397
01:49:56,160 --> 01:49:58,000
unable to repay,
I ran away mom there,

1398
01:49:58,200 --> 01:50:01,500
I earned back money
and came back for her

1399
01:50:01,860 --> 01:50:04,560
she got married and
went away to her husband's home.

1400
01:50:05,030 --> 01:50:08,500
Then?
- Then what? After marriage had kids.

1401
01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:10,160
To her?
 - No, me.

1402
01:50:10,160 --> 01:50:11,060
How come?

1403
01:50:11,060 --> 01:50:16,170
In the sorrow of losing lover,
I opened up many branches.

1404
01:50:16,400 --> 01:50:18,230
You say love, isn't it wrong
to do like this?

1405
01:50:18,230 --> 01:50:22,530
Wrong...isn't it wrong?
That's why I've come back for my love.

1406
01:50:22,740 --> 01:50:24,440
What about the
 girl who married you?

1407
01:50:24,460 --> 01:50:26,800
She went in search
 of her lover.

1408
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:30,160
I came back after knowing my lover
has divorced her husband.

1409
01:50:30,200 --> 01:50:32,740
Yours is very long tale.

1410
01:50:32,930 --> 01:50:36,460
But I don't know how
I'm hurting you in this.

1411
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:40,100
We were about to mix
like milk and honey,

1412
01:50:40,300 --> 01:50:42,930
if you come between us like lime juice,

1413
01:50:42,980 --> 01:50:45,380
milk will get spoilt, sir.
It will be obsolete.

1414
01:50:45,420 --> 01:50:47,860
Neither use it as milk
nor with honey.

1415
01:50:48,060 --> 01:50:52,160
Are you saying I'm in love
with that aunt?

1416
01:50:52,230 --> 01:50:53,460
Yes.

1417
01:50:54,460 --> 01:50:56,860
Only this was lacking
 in my life.

1418
01:50:57,800 --> 01:51:00,130
What did you say
your name was?

1419
01:51:01,400 --> 01:51:03,200
Come here.
- I'll not agree for any adjustment.

1420
01:51:03,260 --> 01:51:07,130
Come closer. Look there!
The girl in pink sari.

1421
01:51:07,230 --> 01:51:10,530
That's my lover.
I love her.

1422
01:51:10,900 --> 01:51:13,200
Not that aunt.
Keep the aunt for yourself.

1423
01:51:13,290 --> 01:51:16,400
What a great
 thing you've said, sir!

1424
01:51:17,400 --> 01:51:19,330
You've hit my heart, sir.

1425
01:51:20,960 --> 01:51:22,500
You're a photographer, right?

1426
01:51:22,630 --> 01:51:24,200
I'm world famous
 in my town.

1427
01:51:24,300 --> 01:51:25,360
Come here.

1428
01:51:25,860 --> 01:51:27,720
Take good photos
of my girl.

1429
01:51:27,800 --> 01:51:29,700
I need it
when I'm alone.

1430
01:51:29,740 --> 01:51:30,900
I'll take good one.

1431
01:51:30,960 --> 01:51:32,260
Why?

1432
01:51:32,430 --> 01:51:34,830
If you don't take
good photos,

1433
01:51:35,140 --> 01:51:37,020
I'll definitely take your girl.

1434
01:51:37,160 --> 01:51:40,730
I may miss her second time,
I'll take her photos now.

1435
01:51:46,260 --> 01:51:47,460
Tell me.

1436
01:51:47,760 --> 01:51:51,730
Don't you remember the stick ice
I bought you?

1437
01:51:51,940 --> 01:51:53,500
Stick ice?

1438
01:51:53,990 --> 01:51:56,460
So many had bought it for me.

1439
01:52:00,690 --> 01:52:02,330
I don't remember.

1440
01:52:03,030 --> 01:52:06,160
I've come back to
 buy you stick ice.

1441
01:52:06,360 --> 01:52:09,430
You mustn't eat if anyone else buys,
only I must buy it for you.

1442
01:52:10,100 --> 01:52:12,530
You've been bringing
 it for 10 years.

1443
01:52:12,730 --> 01:52:16,530
Buy or make me eat,
do whatever you want to do.

1444
01:52:17,600 --> 01:52:23,330
I'll make you eat my stick ice,
first I'll take photos for my boss.

1445
01:52:25,600 --> 01:52:27,160
Where is she?

1446
01:52:28,100 --> 01:52:29,130
She's here.

1447
01:52:29,330 --> 01:52:31,130
I must take a photo without
her knowledge.

1448
01:52:35,160 --> 01:52:37,230
Miss! Now I'll click.

1449
01:52:37,660 --> 01:52:39,060
Missed again.

1450
01:52:40,730 --> 01:52:42,680
Please take my snap.
- Go that side.

1451
01:52:44,200 --> 01:52:46,140
Please take my snap.
- Go away.

1452
01:52:46,180 --> 01:52:48,400
You want photo with that lousy face,
go away.

1453
01:52:53,130 --> 01:52:54,200
Missed her again.

1454
01:52:55,160 --> 01:52:57,060
She's here.

1455
01:52:57,860 --> 01:53:00,530
It's better to take photos
with permission.

1456
01:53:00,730 --> 01:53:03,500
Bus strike, I faced so many problems.

1457
01:53:03,900 --> 01:53:08,940
If you give a good pose,
I'll take a good photo.

1458
01:53:09,030 --> 01:53:10,940
My photo? Why?

1459
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:15,570
Your lover Sharath wanted
a good photograph of you.

1460
01:53:15,730 --> 01:53:16,960
Is Sharath your lover?

1461
01:53:20,260 --> 01:53:22,030
Just one photo, please.

1462
01:53:22,260 --> 01:53:25,300
If you don't give a pose,
he'll take away my lover.

1463
01:53:25,500 --> 01:53:27,600
Please, one photo.

1464
01:53:28,260 --> 01:53:29,300
Where is Sharath now?

1465
01:53:32,990 --> 01:53:33,960
Where's she?

1466
01:53:34,340 --> 01:53:35,730
Why are you sporting a beard?

1467
01:53:36,100 --> 01:53:38,300
What to do? Unemployed.
- Is it?

1468
01:53:40,580 --> 01:53:42,330
Did you try with people I referred?

1469
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
He got beaten up unjustly
in Swathi matter.

1470
01:53:47,360 --> 01:53:48,530
I must say sorry to him.

1471
01:53:52,630 --> 01:53:57,100
Oh no! Why did he
 come here?

1472
01:54:01,160 --> 01:54:02,030
Yes, mom.

1473
01:54:02,230 --> 01:54:07,530
I've got photos of beautiful girls.
I've selected 3 among them.

1474
01:54:07,930 --> 01:54:10,020
I'm sure you'll like them.

1475
01:54:10,060 --> 01:54:14,020
Mother, I don't want to see any photo.
I've seen Swathi again.

1476
01:54:14,190 --> 01:54:18,520
What? Swathi?
- I'll tell you later.

1477
01:54:22,660 --> 01:54:26,300
What happened?
-Sharath cut the phone call.

1478
01:54:26,490 --> 01:54:27,600
Cut the call?

1479
01:54:28,200 --> 01:54:29,130
What's the matter?

1480
01:54:29,530 --> 01:54:32,740
It seems he has met Swathi again.
- Met Swathi?

1481
01:54:32,780 --> 01:54:34,640
Why are you smiling?

1482
01:54:37,030 --> 01:54:38,260
Met Swathi?

1483
01:54:38,430 --> 01:54:40,530
Where?
What's the matter?

1484
01:54:48,160 --> 01:54:51,720
I want to talk to you.
- I'm waiting.

1485
01:55:03,190 --> 01:55:07,930
You wanted to talk but
why are you showing a silent film?

1486
01:55:09,260 --> 01:55:10,400
I'll talk.

1487
01:55:10,520 --> 01:55:12,760
I've stopped drinking.

1488
01:55:13,260 --> 01:55:17,880
You must say something
that will make me happy,

1489
01:55:17,880 --> 01:55:20,730
and throw a big party
to every guest in marriage.

1490
01:55:24,590 --> 01:55:32,660
You said I mustn't see, talk or smile at you in
 marriage, but you've called me here to talk.

1491
01:55:33,130 --> 01:55:36,700
I think I've to book a marriage hall
in Mangalore immediately,

1492
01:55:36,860 --> 01:55:38,100
Shall I?

1493
01:55:42,560 --> 01:55:44,430
What do you think of me?

1494
01:55:44,800 --> 01:55:47,700
Did I say I love you?

1495
01:55:48,260 --> 01:55:50,630
Why did you tell the photographer
that I'm your lover?

1496
01:55:50,730 --> 01:55:51,630
Tell me.

1497
01:55:51,830 --> 01:55:55,530
Oh no! Has a comedian turned
villain in my life?

1498
01:55:55,930 --> 01:55:57,900
He was irritating me,
so I told him.

1499
01:55:58,030 --> 01:56:00,380
What did you tell him?

1500
01:56:00,460 --> 01:56:04,700
That I love you.

1501
01:56:05,330 --> 01:56:09,400
If there is love in my life, it's you.
- No way!

1502
01:56:14,530 --> 01:56:18,530
I never had such feelings for you.

1503
01:56:19,360 --> 01:56:21,530
Why should I love a man like you?

1504
01:56:21,930 --> 01:56:25,880
Those harsh words you told me
or that slap,

1505
01:56:25,880 --> 01:56:28,640
I can never forget that in my life.

1506
01:56:28,690 --> 01:56:31,500
Forget about me entering your life.

1507
01:56:31,760 --> 01:56:35,970
Please leave me alone without
talking about me to others.

Sandeep!
 Come here.

1535
02:00:18,060 --> 02:00:19,770
Got caught with him again.

1536
02:00:19,970 --> 02:00:22,670
I'll hit you with bottle.

1537
02:00:24,070 --> 02:00:28,070
I was always 100 meters
 away from Sharath.

1538
02:00:29,040 --> 02:00:30,800
Come, I've to talk
 with you.

1539
02:00:31,570 --> 02:00:32,740
Come I say!

1540
02:00:53,800 --> 02:00:56,080
What are you doing, Sharath?

1541
02:00:58,200 --> 02:01:01,600
Apologizing for my sin.
Forgiveness.

1542
02:01:01,900 --> 02:01:05,440
You've become a
 bad omen to my life.

1543
02:01:05,640 --> 02:01:08,540
I touched you
 2 years ago,

1544
02:01:08,730 --> 02:01:14,510
I lost my love,
my life and peace.

1545
02:01:14,700 --> 02:01:17,170
So, I beg bowing
 down at your feet.

1546
02:01:17,540 --> 02:01:20,840
Just put your hand on my head
and say you've forgiven me.

1547
02:01:21,040 --> 02:01:23,200
Swathi is here only.

1548
02:01:23,670 --> 02:01:27,040
She may change her heart
and accept my love.

1549
02:01:28,230 --> 02:01:30,870
Why are you thinking?

1550
02:01:32,670 --> 02:01:34,840
What's your problem to
say I've forgiven you?

1551
02:01:35,430 --> 02:01:37,670
Tell me whatever your problem is,
I'll solve it.

1552
02:01:37,870 --> 02:01:39,670
What do you do for living?

1553
02:01:40,140 --> 02:01:42,000
I'm still searching
 for a job.

1554
02:01:42,540 --> 02:01:43,840
Searching for a job?

1555
02:01:47,870 --> 02:01:51,570
Will you forgive me
if I get you a job?

1556
02:01:53,260 --> 02:01:59,260
One of my close friend
is like God,

1557
02:01:59,840 --> 02:02:01,440
I'll send him to you,

1558
02:02:01,640 --> 02:02:03,900
ready him a job and
₹ 1 lakh salary,

1559
02:02:04,100 --> 02:02:05,500
Is that salary
 okay to you?

1560
02:02:05,520 --> 02:02:06,960
1...1...

1561
02:02:08,360 --> 02:02:09,600
Give him ₹ 1 lakh, okay

1562
02:02:14,760 --> 02:02:16,830
At least now say
 you've forgiven me.

1563
02:02:17,430 --> 02:02:21,560
Say!

1564
02:02:21,760 --> 02:02:22,800
Come on say!

1565
02:02:23,260 --> 02:02:24,030
Forgiven you.

1566
02:02:24,760 --> 02:02:25,830
Did you forgive me?

1567
02:02:26,800 --> 02:02:28,330
What's the use?

1568
02:02:31,430 --> 02:02:33,730
But she'll not forgive me.

1569
02:02:35,130 --> 02:02:38,920
Even if I fall at her feet
wash it with my tears,

1570
02:02:38,920 --> 02:02:40,000
she'll not forgive me.

1571
02:02:41,700 --> 02:02:43,730
I've become so cheap to her.

1572
02:02:43,960 --> 02:02:50,500
The great industrialist Sharath is nothing
but an egoistic brute to her.

1573
02:02:52,560 --> 02:02:54,100
Did you fall in love?

1574
02:02:54,890 --> 02:02:55,730
No.

1575
02:02:56,230 --> 02:02:57,260
Never fall in love.

1576
02:02:57,430 --> 02:03:00,800
You're a jockey on falling in love,

1577
02:03:01,330 --> 02:03:03,220
you're a good-for-nothing
 if love fails.

1578
02:03:03,330 --> 02:03:04,460
Like me.

1579
02:03:06,330 --> 02:03:09,040
Shall I talk to Swathi?

1580
02:03:11,560 --> 02:03:13,300
What will you tell her?

1581
02:03:13,700 --> 02:03:16,160
He's a good man,
he got me a job,

1582
02:03:16,200 --> 02:03:19,000
his love is true and pure,
accept it.

1583
02:03:21,800 --> 02:03:24,000
I came to know a truth today,

1584
02:03:24,700 --> 02:03:28,730
if girls decide to forget anyone,

1585
02:03:28,900 --> 02:03:33,430
even Lord Brahma, the creator
can't change it.

1586
02:03:34,660 --> 02:03:37,860
No, what she did was right.

1587
02:03:38,760 --> 02:03:40,000
It wasn't her mistake.

1588
02:03:41,400 --> 02:03:45,640
Without knowing what is love
and how to look after lover

1589
02:03:45,640 --> 02:03:47,260
I loved her very dearly.

1590
02:03:48,730 --> 02:03:50,330
I gave her as much pain too.

1591
02:03:51,060 --> 02:04:00,400
Now, I can see her but can't talk,
smile, live or die!

1592
02:04:00,500 --> 02:04:03,100
To hell with my damned life!

1593
02:04:04,030 --> 02:04:06,060
I'll never get her in my life.

1594
02:04:07,030 --> 02:04:08,960
And I can't forget her too.

1595
02:04:10,760 --> 02:04:13,730
I can't have her and
I won't forget her.

1596
02:04:14,600 --> 02:04:17,160
I can't have her and
I won't forget her.

1597
02:04:18,260 --> 02:04:21,100
I can't have her and
I won't forget her.

I must go to Bangalore with Sharath.

1608
02:06:16,050 --> 02:06:18,090
What are you saying?

1609
02:06:18,290 --> 02:06:20,990
I don't know,
I must go with him.

1610
02:06:26,480 --> 02:06:27,320
May I?

1611
02:06:28,120 --> 02:06:31,190
Friend, I need a help from you.

1612
02:06:31,390 --> 02:06:33,180
One of my people want to
go to Bangalore,

1613
02:06:33,180 --> 02:06:34,390
you've to drop there.

1614
02:06:34,750 --> 02:06:36,020
Okay.
- Call.

1615
02:06:36,020 --> 02:06:37,750
Already sitting in your car.

1616
02:07:02,450 --> 02:07:04,190
Will you please stop the car
for a while?

1617
02:07:53,820 --> 02:07:57,960
I want to talk to you.
Will you please stop the car?

1618
02:08:21,880 --> 02:08:24,120
Don't know why I'm worried.

1619
02:08:25,380 --> 02:08:28,790
I think you'd go away abroad
on reaching Bangalore.

1620
02:08:30,520 --> 02:08:32,190
Please say something, Sharath.

1621
02:08:32,850 --> 02:08:34,650
You wanted to talk to me.

1622
02:08:38,420 --> 02:08:40,050
That is...

1623
02:08:43,520 --> 02:08:46,590
I can't take it anymore.

1624
02:08:47,450 --> 02:08:50,220
When you proposed to me
on my birthday,

1625
02:08:51,090 --> 02:08:54,220
I told you I'm getting engaged,

1626
02:08:55,250 --> 02:08:56,250
it was a lie,

1627
02:08:56,820 --> 02:08:59,850
Sharath, that is...

1628
02:09:24,490 --> 02:09:26,850
Bastard mustn't escape!

1629
02:09:56,350 --> 02:09:58,420
You aspire to become a hero, right?

1630
02:09:59,090 --> 02:10:00,760
Show your heroism now!

1631
02:10:00,850 --> 02:10:01,990
Bash him, boys!

1632
02:11:11,380 --> 02:11:12,150
Leave him!

1633
02:11:39,040 --> 02:11:40,340
What happened, madam?

1634
02:11:54,290 --> 02:11:56,850
You need to have an MRI scan, sir.
Please come with us, sir.

1635
02:11:57,050 --> 02:11:59,320
Specialists are waiting.

1636
02:11:59,750 --> 02:12:02,090
I'm fine,
nothing has happened to me.

1637
02:12:02,450 --> 02:12:05,590
I'm waiting for her
to regain consciousness.

1638
02:12:07,590 --> 02:12:09,550
Just a small test, that's all.

1639
02:12:09,550 --> 02:12:12,450
Press and TV media are waiting outside.

1640
02:12:36,420 --> 02:12:38,390
Sharath is fine.

1641
02:12:38,590 --> 02:12:40,260
Just a little scratch.

1642
02:12:40,420 --> 02:12:42,550
Other than that he's perfectly alright.

1643
02:12:42,550 --> 02:12:44,380
We're doing just routine tests.

1644
02:12:49,440 --> 02:12:50,380
Moreover...

1645
02:13:05,590 --> 02:13:08,050
Father...mother...how is Sharath?

1646
02:13:08,250 --> 02:13:11,490
Sharath has been taken for a scan.
We haven't met him.

1647
02:13:11,650 --> 02:13:14,720
We saw the news on TV.
We came just now.

1648
02:13:15,090 --> 02:13:16,440
What happened to you?

1649
02:13:16,450 --> 02:13:18,320
Father...
- What will happen to her?

1650
02:13:18,520 --> 02:13:19,720
She'll be fine.

1651
02:13:19,980 --> 02:13:22,890
Even if we don't have
 peace in life, she'll be fine.

1652
02:13:23,220 --> 02:13:25,520
Don't talk like that.

1653
02:13:25,690 --> 02:13:27,320
I'm saying right.

1654
02:13:28,820 --> 02:13:34,960
You entered my son's life once and
we had more pain than happiness.

1655
02:13:35,240 --> 02:13:39,260
Are you planning to come back
and ruin peace in our lives?

1656
02:13:39,850 --> 02:13:44,320
Won't your words hurt her?
- I'm telling to hurt her.

1657
02:13:44,520 --> 02:13:47,320
My son loved her so much.

1658
02:13:47,520 --> 02:13:51,420
How much it hurt us!
Have you forgotten it?

1659
02:13:51,620 --> 02:13:53,690
Let her also feel that pain.

1660
02:13:53,880 --> 02:13:57,690
My son has agreed to marry another girl.

1661
02:13:57,880 --> 02:13:59,980
So, I beg you humbly
with folded hands,

1662
02:14:00,020 --> 02:14:03,290
please forget him,
please allow us to live in peace,

1663
02:14:03,490 --> 02:14:04,620
Sorry, mother.

1664
02:14:04,620 --> 02:14:05,720
You wait.

1665
02:14:06,100 --> 02:14:07,250
Think of how to correct it.

1666
02:14:07,450 --> 02:14:09,320
Father, what mother says is right.

1667
02:14:09,520 --> 02:14:12,320
I've already gave you so much of pain.

1668
02:14:12,520 --> 02:14:14,390
I mustn't be here.
I'll go away.

1669
02:14:14,590 --> 02:14:16,720
Please wait, don't listen to her.

1670
02:14:16,920 --> 02:14:18,890
Please father, leave me alone.

1671
02:14:19,250 --> 02:14:23,790
If anyone is hurt by me,
I don't like it.

1672
02:14:23,990 --> 02:14:25,720
Please leave me.

1673
02:14:26,520 --> 02:14:27,950
I beg you.

1674
02:14:28,650 --> 02:14:30,820
Sorry, mother.
- Wait...

1675
02:14:31,990 --> 02:14:33,820

1676
02:14:37,790 --> 02:14:39,250
Father!
- What's this?

1677
02:14:39,420 --> 02:14:40,720
What happened?

1678
02:14:40,920 --> 02:14:42,750
Nothing has happened to me, dad.

1679
02:14:43,820 --> 02:14:45,320
They say whatever happens
it happens for good.

1680
02:14:45,720 --> 02:14:48,850
I'll be happy all my life, dad.
I got back my Swathi, dad.

1681
02:14:49,050 --> 02:14:50,390
I got back my Swathi.

1682
02:14:50,580 --> 02:14:51,950
Haven't you forgotten her yet?

1683
02:14:52,150 --> 02:14:54,420
She ruined our peace once, that's enough.

1684
02:14:54,620 --> 02:14:56,650
She's not here, she has left.

1685
02:14:56,990 --> 02:14:58,950
Where did she go?
- Who knows where?

1686
02:14:59,150 --> 02:15:00,850
Please answer him.

1687
02:15:00,850 --> 02:15:03,250
Get well soon, I'll tell you everything.

1688
02:15:03,650 --> 02:15:05,850
Mother, I'm fine, where's Swathi?.

1689
02:15:05,850 --> 02:15:07,220
Wherever she may be who cares,

1690
02:15:07,420 --> 02:15:11,360
didn't you promise to marry
the girl of my choice?

1691
02:15:12,420 --> 02:15:15,550
What have you done, mom?
When everything was going right...

1692
02:15:17,720 --> 02:15:19,550
Where's Swathi, mom?
- I don't know.

1693
02:15:19,750 --> 02:15:21,320
Where's Swathi, dad?

1694
02:15:21,790 --> 02:15:24,490
Where's Swathi, doctor?
- She left.

1695
02:15:24,490 --> 02:15:25,100
Where?

1696
02:15:25,100 --> 02:15:26,620
She left crying.

1697
02:15:28,150 --> 02:15:30,590
Your matter is going
live coverage since yesterday.

1698
02:15:30,590 --> 02:15:34,490
If you come live on TV,
I'm sure you'll find Swathi.

1699
02:15:34,790 --> 02:15:37,490
Come.
- Please come.

1700
02:15:41,520 --> 02:15:43,490
He's here to talk to you.
Please co-operate.

1701
02:15:43,820 --> 02:15:46,050
I'm fine, nothing has happened to me.

1702
02:15:46,820 --> 02:15:50,190
Swathi, please listen to me.
It happened by mistake.

1703
02:15:50,380 --> 02:15:53,600
Please listen to me,
please come back to me.

1704
02:15:53,800 --> 02:15:55,920
I can't live without you, Swathi.

1705
02:15:56,380 --> 02:15:59,920
Anyone watching this program,
Swathi's photo...

1706
02:16:00,120 --> 02:16:03,390
It's here...here sir.

1707
02:16:03,420 --> 02:16:04,420
She's Swathi.

1708
02:16:04,790 --> 02:16:08,820
If you find her anywhere,
tell her Sharath loves you dearly.

1709
02:16:08,840 --> 02:16:10,050
Please help me to find her.

1710
02:16:10,250 --> 02:16:15,060
Please Swathi, I seek your
forgiveness for the mistake.

1711
02:16:15,650 --> 02:16:18,050
Please tell everyone.
Where are you Swathi?

1712
02:16:18,050 --> 02:16:19,890
Please tell I love her.

1713
02:16:20,080 --> 02:16:21,820
Do you've her number?

1714
02:16:24,250 --> 02:16:25,290
It's ringing.

1715
02:16:29,250 --> 02:16:30,290
Who is it?

1716
02:16:30,750 --> 02:16:31,890
This is not Swathi.

1717
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,280
This is a stolen phone,
come to Mangalore station and take it.

1718
02:16:34,280 --> 02:16:36,480
Railway station?!

1719
02:16:36,850 --> 02:16:37,990
Come, let's go.

1720
02:16:53,850 --> 02:16:55,220
Go fast...fast...

1721
02:16:55,750 --> 02:16:57,090
How far?
- We're very near.

1722
02:16:57,160 --> 02:16:58,150
Go Fast...go fast!

1723
02:16:58,350 --> 02:17:01,320
Trust me, sir.
You'll get Swathi.

1724
02:17:01,520 --> 02:17:05,050
No, you don't know about her.

1725
02:17:05,250 --> 02:17:09,120
I made a small mistake and
I had to endure 2 years of pain.

1726
02:17:09,320 --> 02:17:11,290
Now a big mistake happened
without my knowledge.

1727
02:17:11,480 --> 02:17:14,390
If I miss now,
I'll never get her again.

1728
02:17:14,550 --> 02:17:16,020
Never get her.

1729
02:17:17,250 --> 02:17:18,720
Everything will be fine, sir.

1730
02:17:31,920 --> 02:17:34,220
Give me way...way please...

1731
02:17:35,390 --> 02:17:37,520
Sir, lost phone.
Made a phone call, its here only.

1732
02:17:37,520 --> 02:17:38,420
You're Sharath, right?

1733
02:17:38,420 --> 02:17:41,160
A police officer answered
my phone call.

1734
02:17:41,160 --> 02:17:42,960
Is it? Let's go to the office.
Come...come...

1735
02:17:43,020 --> 02:17:45,190
Quick...

1736
02:17:47,260 --> 02:17:48,350
Please give way!

1737
02:17:48,720 --> 02:17:49,880
Please come here.

1738
02:17:49,900 --> 02:17:53,020
It seems he got a call about
finding his lost mobile.

1739
02:17:53,060 --> 02:17:54,450
Just now I called and
you answered it.

1740
02:17:54,450 --> 02:17:55,890
Yes sir, I answered the call.

1741
02:17:55,890 --> 02:17:58,020
Where's Swathi? Her mobile.
- Come here.

1742
02:17:58,580 --> 02:17:59,820
Tell him.

1743
02:18:00,140 --> 02:18:02,190
A girl left by train now,
I stole her bag.

1744
02:18:02,390 --> 02:18:04,080
A train left 5 minutes ago.

1745
02:18:04,220 --> 02:18:07,020
You can catch it at Sakleshpur
if you go fast.

1746
02:18:07,220 --> 02:18:08,020
Come...come...

1747
02:18:10,690 --> 02:18:15,820
Industrialist Sharath is desperately
searching for his lady love.

1748
02:18:36,680 --> 02:18:38,150
Search there!

1749
02:19:00,060 --> 02:19:02,420
Search entire train.

1750
02:20:49,850 --> 02:20:52,020
My bag got stolen!

1751
02:20:52,890 --> 02:20:56,660
I lost my ticket, mobile
and everything I had.

1752
02:21:01,820 --> 02:21:08,300
I came all the way from there with
 great difficulty, instead of saying I love you,

1753
02:21:08,340 --> 02:21:11,760
are you talking losing ticket and mobile?

1754
02:21:17,790 --> 02:21:20,750
I can't live without you.

1755
02:21:22,120 --> 02:21:23,880
Won't you say I love you?

1756
02:21:24,520 --> 02:21:27,090
I'm not in mood now,
I'll tell after our marriage.

1757
02:22:04,280 --> 02:24:05,160
