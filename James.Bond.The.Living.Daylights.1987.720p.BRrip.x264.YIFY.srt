इदं कर्तव्यमेव, विलासकारयम् तु न.

59
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,424
वेलास्ति.

60
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:11,839
- Now, where's our man?
- In the box. Between the KGB minders.

61
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,559
Lovely girl with the cello.

62
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:28,446
Forget the ladies for once, Bond.

63
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,610
- Koskov will leave here at the interval.
- Sh! Sh!

64
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:35,446
We'd better go.

65
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:10,989
Turn off the lights.

66
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:34,797
Now, let's understand one another, Bond.
General Koskov is a top KGB mastermind.

67
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,803
His defection is my baby. He contacted me.

68
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:40,510
I've planned this out to the last detail.

69
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:46,897
- You'll want the soft-nosed ones, I expect.
- No, the steel-tipped.

70
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,854
KGB snipers usually wear body armour.

71
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:55,276
- What's your escape route?
- Sorry, old man. Section 26, paragraph 5.

72
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:59,033
That information is on
a need-to-know basis only.

73
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,035
I'm sure you understand.

74
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,958
Koskov is under intensive KGB surveillance.

75
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,206
A sniper has been assigned to watch him

76
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:09,381
and he expressly asked
for you to protect him.

77
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:14,090
- Why me?
- He has the impression you're the best.

78
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:19,716
- Where's the car?
- In the alley out the back.

79
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,318
Bring the chair.

80
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:48,166
It'll take him about 10 seconds to reach us.

81
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:51,248
Plenty of time for a sniper
to make strawberry jam of him!

82
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:01,974
(applause)

83
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,552
There's Koskov now.

84
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:48,730
What's he waiting for?

85
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,771
Sniper. Two ﬂoors up, centre window.

86
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,273
The girl with the cello!

87
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,739
Fire, Bond, fire!

88
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:12,625
Shoot her! What are you waiting for?

89
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:18,380
You missed... Deliberately!

90
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,168
Where is he?

91
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:55,463
- In the boot.
- First place they'd look.

92
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:57,916
- But my escape route...
- Scrubbed.

93
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:01,052
Get in the front.

94
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:04,051
- James... James Bond!
- Later, General.

95
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:09,891
Lose them. I'll pick you up at the border.
2300 hours. Be there.

96
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,893
- How will you get him out?
- Sorry, old man.

97
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:17,569
Section 26, paragraph 5: "need-to-know".
I'm sure you understand.

98
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:27,154
- The sniper was a woman.
- I noticed.

99
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:32,542
- Some of the best KGB shots are women.
- Mm-hm.

100
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,628
- Did you...?
- I'd rather not talk about it.

101
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:41,550
No, of course not.

102
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:53,309
They are looking for me! If they
close the border, how will I get out?

103
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:57,984
Don't you worry about that, Georgi.
We have a pipeline to the West.

104
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:14,705
- Rosika Miklos.
- Our man here.

105
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:17,503
Good to work with you
again, Mr Bond. Come.

106
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:21,632
Keep quiet.

107
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,801
(TV sports commentary)

108
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:41,569
- We must hurry. Get him in the pig.
- Pig? What is pig?

109
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:45,615
Scouring plug to clean out the pipeline.
This one's been designed to carry a man.

110
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:49,364
Pipeline? You mean our pipeline?

111
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:52,697
Great Soviet achievement -
piping natural gas into the West.

112
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:56,497
- But... Not me!
- Don't worry, Georgi. It's a piece of cake.

113
00:17:56,701 --> 00:18:01,252
Hm! Never mind cake. If you open valve
before 100, he will be borsch!

114
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:04,835
Pigs! Borsch! Cake!
There must be another way!

115
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:10,132
Get in. Put on the mask
and breathe normally.

116
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:12,467
- Enough talk!
- Relax, Georgi.

117
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,928
Our people have spent months on this.

118
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:17,355
- How many times have you done this?
- You're the first.

119
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:32,032
Remember... When this says 100,
turn this. Not before.

120
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:36,074
- Where are you going?
- To take care of the supervisor.

121
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:40,503
When pig goes, his control panel
will light up like Christmas tree.

Welcome to Austria, General.

128
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,969
Come on. Up you go.

129
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:14,931
Come on, hurry up!

130
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:35,864
(man) That's right. We've got him.

131
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:46,045
Excuse me. Shut it now.

132
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:52,301
Thank you.

133
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:51,319
Cheer up, Saunders.
The operation's a success.

134
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:58,325
- And officially still yours.
- I don't intend to leave it at that, 007.

135
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:03,410
I'm telling M you deliberately missed.
Your orders were to kill that sniper.

136
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:07,335
Stuff my orders. I only kill professionals.

137
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,582
That girl didn't know
one end of a rifle from the other.

138
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:14,793
Go ahead. Tell M what you want.
If he fires me, I'll thank him for it.

139
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:19,926
Whoever she was, I must have
scared the living daylights out of her.

Russian general defects!

141
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:29,766
Ula Yarkhov. Confirmed kills, three.
Probable kills, two.

142
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:34,775
Assassination methods:
strangulation with hands or thighs.

143
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:36,948
James, she's just your type!

144
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:39,366
Wrong again, Moneypenny. You are.

145
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:42,365
I'll file that
with the other secret information.

146
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:45,281
Specialist - child impersonations.

147
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:49,585
Assassination method:
explosive teddy bears.

148
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,163
That's all the KGB female assassins.

149
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:56,752
You know, we could try freelancers
stationed outside the Soviet bloc.

150
00:22:56,834 --> 00:23:00,714
It'll have to wait. M wants you
out at the Blayden safe house.

151
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:04,763
Right. Looks like
it's a dead end here anyway.

152
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:06,936
- (loud rock music)
- Ah! Good!

153
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:27,577
Something we're making for
the Americans. It's called a ghetto blaster.

154
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:33,413
You'd better hurry. M wants you
to stop at Harrods and pick up a parcel.

155
00:23:34,705 --> 00:23:40,132
Moneypenny, ask Records to monitor
Czech publication and news services

156
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:44,181
for any mention of a woman cellist
at the conservatoire in Bratislava.

157
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:47,469
I didn't know
you were such a music lover, James.

158
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:52,022
Any time you want to drop by and
listen to my Barry Manilow collection.

159
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:05,035
- Sorry, sir. Excuse me.
- Bloody Yanks.

160
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:19,175
(muffled music)

161
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:38,652
Good morning, sir.

162
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:41,859
Control here. 007's on his way.

163
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,704
(music on personal stereo)

164
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:54,752
(bleeping)

165
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:57,706
Sorry, Mr Bond.
You'll have to leave the metal.

166
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,918
Thank you, sir.

167
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:05,301
- Good morning, sir. May I help you?
- No, thanks.

168
00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:07,222
They're in the drawing room.

169
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:14,480
- (knocks)
- Come.

170
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:20,273
James!

171
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:23,947
James, I will never forget
what you did for me!

172
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:26,700
Thank you so... What's this?

173
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:32,160
From Harrods. A godsend!
The food here is horrible.

174
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:35,243
- The foie gras is excellent.
- Da, da. As Russians say,

175
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:39,080
hearts and stomachs
good comrades make. (laughs)

176
00:25:39,163 --> 00:25:44,169
What's this? Caviar. Well, that's peasant
food for us, but with champagne it's OK.

177
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:48,677
Bollinger RD. The best! Mm...

178
00:25:48,756 --> 00:25:52,636
The brand on the list was questionable,
sir, so I chose something else.

179
00:25:52,718 --> 00:25:54,766
Superb, Mr Bond!

180
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:57,390
May I suggest we resume the debriefing?

181
00:25:57,473 --> 00:25:59,851
Absolutely. Go ahead. I'm all yours.

182
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:06,694
(music on personal stereo)

183
00:26:06,774 --> 00:26:09,368
- Where's the usual milkman?
- What d'you say?

184
00:26:09,443 --> 00:26:12,492
- Where's the usual man?
- Huh... Flu.

185
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:24,341
- Hey, mate. Watch it!
- Kitchen entrance, round the back.

186
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:28,842
General Leonid Pushkin is why I defect.

187
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:32,425
What? Your KGB superior?

188
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:35,808
Gogol's replacement when
he joined their foreign service.

189
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:39,811
Once we were like brothers,
but now he's a different man.

190
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:43,064
Power has gone to his head.
He's sick, like Stalin!

191
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:45,987
He hates our new policy of détente.

192
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:56,783
I have here a secret directive
from Pushkin. Smiert Spionom.

193
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,456
- "Death to Spies", Minister.
- Da.

194
00:27:00,911 --> 00:27:05,917
<i>For an assassination programme, with list
of targets - British and American agents.</i>

195
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:09,758
When this starts, you will retaliate.

196
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:13,512
Soviet and Western Intelligence
could destroy each other.

197
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,718
This might lead to nuclear war!

198
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:19,146
Unless Pushkin can be... How do you say?

199
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:22,441
Put away.

200
00:27:24,101 --> 00:27:27,025
- Where is Pushkin now? In Moscow?
- Da.

201
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:30,358
But in three days he will leave for Tangier.

202
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:34,490
Cover - North African trade convention.

203
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:38,616
Real reason?

204
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:40,793
New directive.

205
00:27:43,871 --> 00:27:48,877
Minister, in view of the importance
of what Mr Koskov has just told us

206
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:51,929
I believe we should
consult with higher authority.

207
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:56,100
- By all means. Good day, Mr Koskov.
- Good day, sir.

208
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,812
There you go. There's a good lad.

209
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:21,079
- Good morning.
- Morning. Put it down there, would you?

210
00:28:21,158 --> 00:28:22,831
Ta.

211
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:35,930
Green Four to base!

212
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:48,189
Green Four, this is control. Where are you?

213
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:54,366
<i>Green Four?</i>

214
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:06,411
Argh!

215
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:22,895
<i>You may have</i> a <i>malfunction</i>

216
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:31,020
Green Four to base.
We have gas leaks in main building.

217
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:35,825
Some personnel overcome. Evacuate.
Send for emergency medical services.

218
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:38,444
<i>Green Four, I read and understand you.</i>

219
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:42,623
<i>(Tannoy) Control to all stations.
Code 10. Initiate emergency drill.</i>

220
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:44,917
<i>- (siren)
- Evacuate the main building.</i>

221
00:29:44,992 --> 00:29:47,370
<i>Emergency. Emergency.</i>

222
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:50,422
<i>All personnel evacuate the main building.</i>

223
00:29:55,002 --> 00:29:59,633
Green Four to base. Major gas explosion.
Keep clear of the main building.

224
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:02,726
KGB!

225
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:14,897
Keep back!

226
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:20,327
- Get up. Come on!
- Don't kill me! Don't kill me!

227
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:26,325
Move.

228
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:28,285
Move!

229
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:33,257
Keep clear of the main building.
Assistance is on its way.

230
00:30:40,047 --> 00:30:41,765
(helicopter)

231
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:47,179
- Who's that for?
- You, comrade.

232
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:49,060
Help him or I kill you both.

233
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:57,276
<i>(Tannoy)
Security must be maintained at all times.</i>

234
00:30:57,356 --> 00:30:59,529
Move! Hurry.

235
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:03,488
<i>Only emergency sen/ices
should be allowed in the</i> area.

236
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:13,205
<i>Please be calm</i>

237
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:15,591
<i>Stay away from the house.</i>

238
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,922
<i>Please don't use your private radiophones</i>

239
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:47,827
Two dead, two in hospital, and Koskov
probably back in Moscow, if not dead.

240
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:51,118
We're the laughing stock
of the Intelligence community.

241
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:56,583
Our first major coup in years, snatched
from right under our noses by the KGB

242
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:58,759
only hours after he defected!

243
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:00,928
- No trace of him?
- Nothing.

244
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:04,757
- Then there's this Pushkin matter.
- Mm. Well, I must be off.

245
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:07,642
Meeting with the PM this afternoon.

246
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:13,398
<i>We have to nip Smiert Spionom in the bud.</i>

247
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:18,062
Pushkin should be in Tangiers
in two days' time.

248
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:21,156
A termination warrant
has been issued for him.

249
00:32:21,231 --> 00:32:25,031
This plot to kill agents
sounds rather far-fetched, sir.

250
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:28,322
- I know General Pushkin
- Do you think I don't?

251
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:31,375
I've dealt with him on several occasions!

252
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:36,877
Our paths have crossed over the years.
He's tough and resourceful, but...

253
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:41,256
- I can't believe he's a psychotic.
- Neither did I until today.

254
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:44,588
This arrived from Gibraltar.
It was found near 004's body.

255
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:52,846
Your name was on Pushkin's list, too, 007.

256
00:32:56,725 --> 00:33:02,277
There are a few things I'd like to check
out first, sir. That sniper, for instance.

257
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:06,155
Yes... I've read Saunders' report
You jeopardised the mission

258
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:12,162
- to avoid shooting a beautiful girl.
- I had to make a split-second decision.

259
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,959
- It was instinct.
- I'll recall 008 from Hong Kong.

260
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:17,504
He can do it. He doesn't know Pushkin.

261
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:20,833
He follows orders, not instincts.

262
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:24,087
- You can take a fortnight's leave.
- No!

263
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:26,680
Sir.

264
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:32,519
If it has to be done, I'd rather do it.

265
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:38,438
Right, bring it down slowly. Gently now.

266
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:41,441
- Morning, Q.
-Ah, morning, 007. Ow!

267
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,818
Mind your head.

268
00:33:43,897 --> 00:33:47,652
I've got something for you.
We're just winterising this.

269
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:53,036
Now, pay attention, 007.

270
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:56,744
- A key-ring finder. (whistles)
- (bleeps)

271
00:33:56,952 --> 00:34:00,673
- Surprise me.
- You arm it by pressing that button there.

272
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:02,749
Like that. See?

273
00:34:04,334 --> 00:34:06,428
Right. Now wear that.

274
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:11,804
Right. Now... Whistle
the first bars of "Rule, <i>Britannia</i>

275
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,307

276
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:27,195
Stun gas. Effective range?
Ooh, about ﬁve feet.

277
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:32,162
Disorientates any normal person
for about... Ooh, 30 seconds.

278
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:36,037
You don't find too many
normal people in this business, Q.

279
00:34:36,116 --> 00:34:39,040
<i>What is it to blow up the room -
"God Save the Queen"?</i>

280
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:44,091
It so happens, 007, that we've packed
the finder with concentrated explosive,

281
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:46,634
sufficient to remove the door of any safe.

282
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:51,216
It's magnetic.
The actuating signal is personalised.

283
00:34:51,298 --> 00:34:53,847
- What's my code?
- Oh, most appropriate.

284
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:56,971
- A wolf whistle.
- You mean, um...

285
00:34:58,013 --> 00:35:00,107
Stop!

286
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:03,644
You may find the keys useful.

287
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:07,152
They open 90% of the world's locks.

288
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:13,161
All right, sit down and
make yourself comfortable.

289
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:21,753
- Well done, Moneypenny. That's her.
- Records sent over this translation.

290

That girl must be very talented.

Believe me, my interest in her
is purely professional.

- Just taking the Aston Martin for a spin
- Be careful, 007.

It's just had a new coat of paint!

00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:44,576
I saw what happened on the tram.
Where did they take you?

309
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:49,247
KGB headquarters?

310
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:52,955
They released me this morning.

311
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:54,707
Take a look across the street.

312
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:00,875
They let you go so they could follow you.

313
00:41:07,924 --> 00:41:11,519
I don't understand.
Why are you trying to help me?

314
00:41:14,347 --> 00:41:15,439
What did Pushkin want?

315
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:19,231
Did he ask you about Georgi Koskov?

316
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,908
He wanted to know where he was.

317
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:29,488
- Did you tell him?
- No.

318
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:32,289
That was clever of Georgi...using blanks.

319
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:38,663
Made the British believe
his defection was real.

320
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:39,963
How do you know that?

321
00:41:41,082 --> 00:41:42,083
He told me.

322
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:46,929
- You saw him?
- Two days ago. He's safe and sound.

323
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:53,553
- You're a friend of his?
- We've been through quite a lot together.

324
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:56,599
Oh, dear Georgi!

325
00:41:57,265 --> 00:41:59,893
He kept his promise to send for me.

326
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:03,062
Where are we going? To London?

327
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:07,988
No, not yet. The British think
he'll be safer if he keeps moving around.

328
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:11,537
- We might catch up with him in Vienna.
- Vienna?

329
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:15,458
We must leave immediately,
before they pick you up again.

330
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,627
- But how?
- We'll manage.

331
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:20,125
Get packed. Bring some warm clothes.

332
00:43:25,186 --> 00:43:27,689
Looks like we got away with it.

333
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:33,744
My cello! It's at the conservatoire.

334
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:37,120
- I'll get you another in Vienna.
- No, we must go back for it.

335
00:43:37,198 --> 00:43:40,668
We have 10 minutes before
they discover what's happened.

336
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:43,667
- I must get my cello.
- No way!

337
00:43:59,929 --> 00:44:02,023
Come on, get in!

338
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:07,979
Why didn't you learn the violin?

339
00:44:20,867 --> 00:44:22,915
(jazz music on car radio)

340
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:37,554
(talking on radio)

341
00:44:39,969 --> 00:44:42,188
You've picked up the police band.

342
00:44:42,263 --> 00:44:44,857
There must be an atmospheric anomaly.

343
00:44:48,311 --> 00:44:52,157
They're looking for a foreign car...
A man and a woman.

344
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:53,904
And a cello!

345
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:02,287
Looks like they just found us.

346
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:04,001
(Siren)

347
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:18,383
Pull over to the side and stop!

348
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:39,825
- What happened?
- Salt corrosion.

349
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:42,786
(voices on radio)

350
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:46,669
They're setting up roadblocks.

351
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:14,022
- What is this?
- I've had a few optional extras installed.

352
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:29,378
(machine-gun fire)

353
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:41,390
Amazing, this modern safety glass.

354
00:46:43,384 --> 00:46:44,636
Look out!

355
00:46:56,022 --> 00:46:57,990
See where this leads to.

356
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:03,037
This road only leads to the lake.

357
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:30,356
Time to leave.

358
00:48:06,926 --> 00:48:08,894
- James!
- (siren)

359
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:34,704
Brace yourself.

360
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:06,193
We almost made it.

361
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:14,418
Come on, quick! Go!

362
00:49:17,455 --> 00:49:19,128
(ticking)

363
00:49:26,547 --> 00:49:28,515
Glad I insisted you brought that cello!

364
00:50:07,588 --> 00:50:09,431
Sorry!

365
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:14,057
Not far now!

366
00:50:23,062 --> 00:50:25,440
Here, wave this.

367
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:30,661
Duck!

368
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:34,286
- We've nothing to declare!
- Just a cello!

369
00:50:41,664 --> 00:50:43,758
(call to prayer)

370
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:08,695
(camera clicks)

371
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:14,955
(beeping)

372
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:27,168
If you wait here, sir, I'll find the chief.

373
00:51:46,312 --> 00:51:48,861
General Pushkin, it's a pleasure.

374
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:52,489
I'm Brad Whitaker.
Didn't expect to see you in Tangiers.

375
00:51:52,568 --> 00:51:55,617
- General Koskov with you?
- <i>Nyet.</i>

376
00:51:55,696 --> 00:51:59,121
War... War has always been
man's main occupation.

377
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:03,249
Fools say his greatest accomplishments
were the wheel and the alphabet.

378
00:52:03,329 --> 00:52:05,707
I say it's a battering ram and gunpowder.

379
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:08,634
How do you like my pantheon
of great commanders?

380
00:52:08,709 --> 00:52:11,929
- Butchers.
- Surgeons.

381
00:52:12,004 --> 00:52:16,180
They cutaway society's dead ﬂesh.
Let me show you something.

382
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:18,431
At ease, Sergeant. This way, sir.

383
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:25,939
My hobby - the strategy and tactics
of the world's historic battles.

384
00:52:26,018 --> 00:52:28,817
(fanfares and gunﬁre on tape)

385
00:52:28,896 --> 00:52:32,196
Afghanistan, the North-West Frontier, 1895.

386
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:35,448
The initial trial of the first
automatic machine gun.

387
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:37,780
The .303-calibre Maxim.

388
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:41,367
The King's Royal Rifles
wiped out a vastly superior force.

389
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:44,750
Kept the British in Afghanistan
for another <i>25</i> years.

390
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:49,004
What you Russians need nowadays
is the equivalent of a modern Maxim.

391
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:52,131
Third-generation starlight scope.

392
00:52:52,211 --> 00:52:56,887
A laser-sighting, short-barrelled
machine pistol. Infantry mini-missiles.

393
00:52:56,965 --> 00:53:00,686
Range - 5km.
And smart... Just fire and forget.

394
00:53:00,761 --> 00:53:03,514
It penetrates all existing armour.

395
00:53:03,597 --> 00:53:06,191
Yes, sir! Samples of everything ordered.

396
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:08,860
- The order is cancelled.
- Huh?

397
00:53:08,936 --> 00:53:12,816
You'll return our deposit
of $50 million within the next 48 hours.

398
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:14,992
You can't be serious, General.

399
00:53:15,067 --> 00:53:17,991
Do you know how hard it is
to obtain this equipment?

400
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:20,539
This is the latest US and European stuff.

401
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:23,868
I've made commitments,
letters of credit, special payoffs.

402
00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:28,460
We know that you've had our money
in your Swiss account for eight weeks

403
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:31,213
and that you have made
no payments of any kind.

404
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:34,090
Look, I can't cancel orders at this late date.

405
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:37,264
As one soldier to another,
you have my word of honour...

406
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:42,436
Spare me your military pretensions.
What army did you serve in?

407
00:53:42,511 --> 00:53:45,515
You were expelled
from West Point for cheating.

408
00:53:46,181 --> 00:53:49,560
Then a short stint as
a mercenary in the Belgian Congo.

409
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:54,240
Later you worked with various criminals
to help finance your first arms deals.

410
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:57,318
Lies spread by my competitors.

411
00:53:57,401 --> 00:54:00,496
You forget your many
so-called wars of liberation

412
00:54:00,571 --> 00:54:04,792
that I have supplied through General
Koskov. Those are my credentials.

413
00:54:04,867 --> 00:54:10,089
The money in two days, or you'll find
yourself out of business permanently.

414
00:54:10,164 --> 00:54:12,667
Georgi Koskov as well.

415
00:54:13,459 --> 00:54:16,383
I don't know what you two are scheming,

416
00:54:16,462 --> 00:54:19,682
but it is over. ls that understood?

417
00:54:26,054 --> 00:54:28,148
Careful.

418
00:54:40,736 --> 00:54:42,329
Taxi!

419
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:53,799
Vienna's beautiful, just like Georgi said.

420
00:54:53,874 --> 00:54:57,845
- You care for him a great deal, don't you?
- I owe him everything.

421
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:02,050
My scholarship
at the conservatoire, my Strad...

422
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:06,979
<i>-</i> Your cello‘s a Stradivarius?
- A famous one. The Lady Rose.

423
00:55:07,054 --> 00:55:09,933
- Georgi got it in New York.
- Quite a present.

424
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:14,065
Maybe someday I'll play there.
At Carnegie Hall?

425
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:17,819
- Georgi believes I can do it.
- I'm sure he's right.

426
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:22,574
- We go to him now?
- Yeah. Unless he had to move on.

427
00:55:23,821 --> 00:55:26,574
If he did, I'm sure he left a message.

428
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:30,252
(Viennese waltz)

429
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:10,413
<i>Danke.</i>

430
00:56:10,742 --> 00:56:12,836
- Careful.
- Careful.

431
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:24,719
Oh, good afternoon, Mr Bond.

432
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:29,137
- You will need your usual suite?
- Not tonight, Hans.

433
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:31,313
- We need a second bedroom.
- Yes, sir.

434
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:35,018
- Shall I have vodka martinis sent up?
- Shaken, not stirred.

435
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:37,194
Of course.

436
00:56:42,149 --> 00:56:43,401
<i>Universal Exports.</i>

437
00:56:43,483 --> 00:56:47,238
Bond here. I need two tickets for the
opera tonight, to be left at the box office.

438
00:57:02,127 --> 00:57:06,098
- Do you like it?
- For princess or wife of commissar?

439
00:57:06,173 --> 00:57:08,642
- Let's buy it.
- Don't joke!

440
00:57:08,717 --> 00:57:11,766
- Who will pay?
- Georgi, of course.

441
00:57:22,731 --> 00:57:25,655
Mm... mmm...

442
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:30,247
Please... Stop it.

443
00:57:34,618 --> 00:57:36,712
The chief wants you.

444
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:49,804
Oh!

445
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:53,186
We have to report.

446
00:58:06,233 --> 00:58:08,531
Very good. At ease, Sergeant.

447
00:58:10,195 --> 00:58:12,289
Pushkin wants the money back.

448
00:58:13,365 --> 00:58:18,667
Don't worry. We've convinced
the British that Pushkin is a danger.

449
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:22,966
They will send their best man,
James Bond, to eliminate him.

450
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:25,885
I'm not convinced. Necros can do it.

451
00:58:25,961 --> 00:58:30,011
I've worked with the Russians.
My appearance is well known to them.

452
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:33,515
It could jeopardise my comrades
who depend upon me.

453
00:58:33,593 --> 00:58:38,099
And they depend upon me. Where else
will they find a supply of arms?

454
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:40,309
Our basic plan is sound.

455
00:58:40,392 --> 00:58:43,316
Pushkin is... How you say... History.

456
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:46,231
Not yet. James Bond
hasn't laid a finger on him.

457
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:48,442
- The British are cautious.
- Yeah.

458
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:51,779
An additional inducement will ensure this.

459
00:58:51,862 --> 00:58:55,742
For instance,
if another agent were... Eliminated...

460
00:58:57,868 --> 00:59:01,964
Do it. But if Pushkin is alive on
the last day of the conference, kill him!

461
00:59:02,289 --> 00:59:04,667
<i>(Mozart "The Marriage of Figaro")</i>

462
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:59,309
- All my life I've dreamed of this.
- You might play here one day.

463
00:59:59,387 --> 01:00:03,563
That's too much to hope for.
Excuse me for a few moments.

464
01:00:12,943 --> 01:00:14,661
- ls that...?
- The cello girl.

465
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:18,286
- The KGB sniper? Why bring her here?
- She's not a KGB sniper.

466
01:00:18,365 --> 01:00:21,335
She's Koskov's girlfriend.

467
01:00:21,409 --> 01:00:24,538
She shot blanks to make
his defection look real to us.

468
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:27,875
Koskov's defection phoney?
The KGB snatched him back.

469
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:29,551
That's what we were supposed to think.

470
01:00:30,752 --> 01:00:35,553
These are serious accusations, Bond.
What are you up to?

471
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:39,512
I'm posing as Koskov's friend
to see what leads I can get from her.

472
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:46,018
You know he bought her a cello
in New York called the Lady Rose?

473
01:00:46,101 --> 01:00:50,072
- A cello with a name?
- Mm-hm. It's a Stradivarius.

474
01:00:50,147 --> 01:00:52,400
They all have names.

475
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:55,110
Where would Koskov get the money?
Check it out.

476
01:00:55,193 --> 01:01:00,290
I'll need papers for her... Tonight. I have
to get her out of the country by tomorrow.

477
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:03,793
Here. I took these this afternoon.

478
01:01:04,452 --> 01:01:08,298
Look, this is highly irregular.
I won't get the OK from London today.

479
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:14,130
It can't wait, Saunders. That girl's
our only chance of getting Koskov back.

480
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:16,556
(bell rings)

481
01:01:20,385 --> 01:01:24,936
Very well.
I've got nothing to lose but my pension.

482
01:01:25,015 --> 01:01:30,567
Meet me at the Prater Cafe
near the Ferris wheel at midnight.

483
01:01:58,215 --> 01:02:00,718
- No more.
- This one!

484
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:14,565
Waaaargh! Ha ha ha ha ha!

485
01:02:20,153 --> 01:02:22,030
Take me on the wheel.

486
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:45,812
You'll be able to see better.

487
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:50,187
(music on personal stereo)

488
01:02:50,308 --> 01:02:52,356
<i>- Bal/on, mein Herr?
- Nein.</i>

489
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:03,826
Is it real or just a dream?

490
01:03:24,551 --> 01:03:26,849
What's wrong? Why do we stop?

491
01:03:28,972 --> 01:03:31,066
I arranged it.

492
01:03:31,141 --> 01:03:33,235
We could be here all night.

493
01:03:39,983 --> 01:03:41,576
Don't.

494
01:03:41,693 --> 01:03:43,991
It's impossible.

495
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:48,792
Knowing you only two days and all I can
think of is how we would be together.

496
01:03:51,244 --> 01:03:52,291
Don't think.

497
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:54,338
Just let it happen.

498
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:29,207
(laughter)

499
01:04:31,451 --> 01:04:33,203
Do you want another ride?

500
01:04:47,258 --> 01:04:51,104
I'll be back in a minute.
There may be a message for me.

501
01:04:59,145 --> 01:05:01,739
(personal stereo)

502
01:05:04,984 --> 01:05:09,740
<i>Where has every body gone?</i>

503
01:05:09,823 --> 01:05:11,166
(bleeps)

504
01:05:11,282 --> 01:05:15,082
It was bought recently
at auction in New York.

505
01:05:15,161 --> 01:05:20,668
Lot 124, the Lady Rose,
a cello by Stradivarius of Cremona, 1724.

506
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:23,594
SO|d for $150,000

507
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:26,343
to Brad Whitaker.

508
01:05:27,006 --> 01:05:29,304
Whitaker? The arms dealer?

509
01:05:29,467 --> 01:05:31,515
The same.

510
01:05:32,345 --> 01:05:34,439
Koskov and Whitaker...

511
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:39,937
- Where's Whitaker now?
- At his place in Tangier.

512
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:44,319
Well done.

513
01:05:46,526 --> 01:05:48,620
Good luck.

514
01:05:48,987 --> 01:05:50,455
Saunders...

515
01:05:52,365 --> 01:05:54,288
Thanks.

516
01:06:30,862 --> 01:06:33,035
Where are you going?

517
01:06:44,709 --> 01:06:46,757
What's the matter?

518
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:51,307
Bad accident back there.

519
01:06:51,382 --> 01:06:52,429
Did you hear?

520
01:06:54,594 --> 01:06:56,688
Hear from Georgi?

521
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:02,444
Yes.

522
01:07:02,936 --> 01:07:05,234
I got the message.

523
01:07:08,066 --> 01:07:11,866
He's with Whitaker in Tangier.

524
01:07:11,945 --> 01:07:15,040
Brad Whitaker? The American?

525
01:07:15,114 --> 01:07:17,708
- You know him?
- He's a patron of the arts.

526
01:07:17,784 --> 01:07:19,036
Georgi said he'd help me.

527
01:07:20,912 --> 01:07:23,415
How soon do we have to go?

528
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:29,387
Immediately. I promised Georgi
I'd get you back as soon <i>as</i> I could.

529
01:07:29,462 --> 01:07:31,635
Can't we stay here a few days?

530
01:07:31,756 --> 01:07:34,305
No. We leave first thing in the morning.

531
01:07:42,809 --> 01:07:44,903
(Moroccan music)

532
01:09:49,185 --> 01:09:51,279
ls anything wrong?

533
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:57,194
- Bond!
- Don't make any sudden moves, General.

534
01:09:58,069 --> 01:10:00,117
Go to the table.

535
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:20,975
Sit down.

536
01:10:31,144 --> 01:10:34,318
I take it that this is not a social call, O07.

537
01:10:34,439 --> 01:10:36,658
Correct. You should have brought lilies.

538
01:10:40,403 --> 01:10:43,247
- May I ask why?
- Smien‘ Spionom.

539
01:10:43,322 --> 01:10:45,450
<i>Smiert Spionom?</i>

540
01:10:46,451 --> 01:10:51,673
That was a Beria operation in Stalin's
time. It was deactivated 20 years ago.

541
01:10:51,748 --> 01:10:55,093
- Two of our agents are dead.
- My condolences.

542
01:10:55,168 --> 01:10:56,670
We had nothing to do with it.

543
01:11:02,759 --> 01:11:03,885
Where's Koskov?

544
01:11:04,761 --> 01:11:09,107
He disappeared two weeks ago.
I was about to have him arrested.

545
01:11:09,182 --> 01:11:12,686
- Why?
- For misusing state funds.

546
01:11:13,186 --> 01:11:14,403
Involving Whitaker?

547
01:11:15,188 --> 01:11:18,192
That is a security matter
and cannot be discussed.

548
01:11:18,357 --> 01:11:19,529
(beeping)

549
01:11:21,444 --> 01:11:23,867
That was damn stupid!

550
01:11:23,946 --> 01:11:25,664
(beeping)

551
01:11:42,507 --> 01:11:45,135
Get in the bathroom and lock the door.

552
01:11:49,889 --> 01:11:51,983
Stay where you are!

553
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:57,238
Get down on your knees.

554
01:12:00,066 --> 01:12:02,160
Put your hands behind your back.

555
01:12:04,487 --> 01:12:07,787
You are professional.
You do not kill without reason.

556
01:12:08,491 --> 01:12:10,585
Two of our men are dead.
Koskov's named you.

557
01:12:12,370 --> 01:12:16,091
- Now, why should I disobey my orders?
- I am in the dark as much as you are.

558
01:12:17,416 --> 01:12:21,421
It is a question of trust. Who do you believe?

559
01:12:21,546 --> 01:12:23,844
Koskov... Or me?

560
01:12:23,923 --> 01:12:26,517
If I trusted Koskov, we wouldn't be talking.

561
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:33,934
But as long as you're alive,
we'll never know what he's up to.

562
01:12:40,565 --> 01:12:41,987
Then I must die.

563
01:12:43,401 --> 01:12:44,948
Ladies and gentlemen,

564
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:48,873
it is my honour to introduce
the head of the Russian delegation,

565
01:12:48,948 --> 01:12:51,042
Comrade Leonid Pushkin.

566
01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:04,138
Comrade delegates,

567
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:09,477
I bring you profound fraternal greetings
from your comrades in Soviet Union.

568
01:13:09,594 --> 01:13:11,392
(gunshots)

569
01:13:27,737 --> 01:13:29,910
No! No!

570
01:13:36,787 --> 01:13:38,505
Seal the building!

571
01:14:14,659 --> 01:14:16,707
(speaks Arabic)

572
01:14:21,374 --> 01:14:23,502
(woman sobs)

573
01:15:00,746 --> 01:15:03,249
Hey! You looking for a party?

574
01:15:03,874 --> 01:15:05,922
Seems like a good idea.

575
01:15:09,922 --> 01:15:12,596
I'm sorry to put you through that, my dear.

576
01:15:16,595 --> 01:15:22,443
It is the first time I've ever been grateful
that James Bond is a good shot!

577
01:15:24,895 --> 01:15:29,696
Pull over here. We can have a party
some other time. A little present for you.

578
01:15:33,070 --> 01:15:36,040
Not enough? Take it all.

579
01:15:41,787 --> 01:15:44,757
Just sit back and enjoy the ride.

580
01:16:09,273 --> 01:16:11,321
Down below.

581
01:16:15,321 --> 01:16:19,667
What the hell are you trying to do, 007?
Start World War Ill?

582
01:16:19,742 --> 01:16:23,747
Felix Leiter!
Now, what's the CIA doing here?

583
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:25,172
Nice work, girls.

584
01:16:25,790 --> 01:16:28,714
- No hard feelings?
- Not if the party's still on.

585
01:16:32,004 --> 01:16:37,101
It's a long story, Felix, but in the end
Pushkin makes a miraculous recovery.

586
01:16:37,176 --> 01:16:39,679
You mean this is a put-up job?

587
01:16:41,347 --> 01:16:44,271
- What's all this?
- We've been watching Pushkin

588
01:16:44,350 --> 01:16:46,478
since he met two days ago with Whitaker.

589
01:16:46,769 --> 01:16:50,273
- An illegal arms deal with the Russians?
- You've got me, James.

590
01:16:50,356 --> 01:16:55,453
Whitaker has a few samples of hi-tech
stuff, but he's placed no big orders yet.

591
01:16:55,528 --> 01:17:00,409
Looks like we're working on the same
case from opposite ends. Let's talk shop.

592
01:17:01,992 --> 01:17:04,461
Ah! Well done!

593
01:17:04,537 --> 01:17:07,211
Congratulations. We heard it over the radio.

594
01:17:07,289 --> 01:17:10,042
I didn't kill him. Bond did.

595
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:14,214
- I told you the British believed me!
- (phone rings)

596
01:17:14,338 --> 01:17:16,386
I told you!

597
01:17:16,465 --> 01:17:19,969
Now we can move. I'll signal
Amsterdam to ship the diamonds.

598
01:17:20,052 --> 01:17:22,726
- Sir?
- Hello? Yes.

599
01:17:24,390 --> 01:17:26,518
Who?

600
01:17:28,018 --> 01:17:30,066
It's for you.

601
01:17:34,525 --> 01:17:36,573
Hello?

602
01:17:46,871 --> 01:17:48,919
(cello music)

603
01:18:00,718 --> 01:18:04,393
Where have you been, James?
You were gone so long, I was worried!

604
01:18:05,014 --> 01:18:09,520
It's always nice to be missed.
Still no sign of Georgi.

605
01:18:09,602 --> 01:18:11,730
- No, please. Go on playing.
- No.

606
01:18:13,689 --> 01:18:15,783
Let's have a drink.

607
01:18:25,951 --> 01:18:27,077
You remembered.

608
01:18:33,125 --> 01:18:35,469
To us.

609
01:18:35,586 --> 01:18:37,634
<i>Na zdra vi ye</i>

610
01:18:41,217 --> 01:18:42,514
Did I get it right?

611
01:18:44,136 --> 01:18:46,264
Mmm... Perfect.

612
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:50,268
What's the matter?

613
01:18:54,230 --> 01:18:56,983
Kara, it's time I told you the truth.

614
01:18:58,734 --> 01:19:03,080
I'm not a friend of Georgi's.
I'm a British agent looking for him.

615
01:19:03,155 --> 01:19:07,752
He's betrayed us all, Kara.
The Russians, the British,

616
01:19:07,826 --> 01:19:09,920
even you.

617
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:15,586
He told us a sniper might try to kill him.

618
01:19:15,668 --> 01:19:19,013
And he set you up <i>as</i> the sniper, Kara.

619
01:19:19,129 --> 01:19:22,679
He wants you dead. You knew too much.

620
01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:26,604
Liar! You pretended to love me!

621
01:19:26,679 --> 01:19:31,936
I telephoned Whitaker.
Georgi was there. He told me the truth.

622
01:19:32,017 --> 01:19:35,521
You're a KGB agent,
using me to find him and kill him!

623
01:19:35,646 --> 01:19:37,523
No, that's not...

624
01:19:37,648 --> 01:19:39,696
That's not true. I...

625
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:44,200
That's. ..

626
01:19:46,198 --> 01:19:48,200
Chloral hydrate!

627
01:19:48,284 --> 01:19:51,333
- Keep your hands off me!
- Kara, listen to me!

628
01:19:54,373 --> 01:19:56,717
The riﬂe was shot out of your hands.

629
01:19:56,792 --> 01:19:59,295
- How do you know?
- Because I was the...

630
01:20:00,462 --> 01:20:03,011
I was the man sent to kill you.

631
01:20:04,383 --> 01:20:05,430
Why didn't you?

632
01:20:20,149 --> 01:20:23,744
Kara, my darling,
you were absolutely perfect.

633
01:20:25,321 --> 01:20:26,664
L-luFFY

634
01:20:26,989 --> 01:20:28,912
(Siren)

635
01:20:42,755 --> 01:20:44,849
<i>Sortez, s'iI vous plait.</i>

636
01:21:01,607 --> 01:21:03,701
<i>Merci, monsieur.</i>

637
01:21:11,283 --> 01:21:13,377
Open it, please.

638
01:21:14,787 --> 01:21:17,415
Careful. It must be kept absolutely sterile.

639
01:21:18,707 --> 01:21:20,801
Urgh! Go.

640
01:22:13,971 --> 01:22:16,645
I've been such a fool.

641
01:22:17,808 --> 01:22:20,152
We both have.

642
01:22:20,227 --> 01:22:21,353
Open the lid.

643
01:22:22,438 --> 01:22:24,782
(93393) Oh, my God!

644
01:22:24,857 --> 01:22:26,905
That's not human. It's an animal's heart.

645
01:22:31,989 --> 01:22:35,038
Diamonds hidden in the ice.

646
01:22:36,618 --> 01:22:38,871
(toilet ﬂushes)

647
01:22:38,996 --> 01:22:43,217
- How can I help you?
- I need my key ring. Look out!

648
01:22:43,333 --> 01:22:45,381
(Bond groans)

649
01:23:09,359 --> 01:23:10,736
Black coffee for our guest.

650
01:23:14,573 --> 01:23:17,247
She has so many talents!

651
01:23:17,367 --> 01:23:18,835
I'm curious.

652
01:23:19,495 --> 01:23:22,920
- Why didn't you kill me?
- Oh, I'm not a barbarian, James.

653
01:23:22,998 --> 01:23:25,751
I'm taking you
to the proper Soviet authorities

654
01:23:25,876 --> 01:23:28,971
for the killing of General Pushkin.

655
01:23:32,257 --> 01:23:37,354
You're a wonder, Georgi!
You get me to kill Pushkin for you.

656
01:23:37,429 --> 01:23:39,397
Then you turn me in
to the Russians for his murder.

657
01:23:40,599 --> 01:23:44,274
What are you going to ask for? Immunity?

658
01:23:44,394 --> 01:23:47,364
Permission to emigrate
and enjoy the amenities of the West?

659
01:23:48,357 --> 01:23:51,361
You don't think they'll
condone your defection?

660
01:23:51,443 --> 01:23:53,116
What defection?

661
01:23:53,237 --> 01:23:56,537
I have been on a secret mission
for General Pushkin

662
01:23:56,615 --> 01:23:59,619
to disinform British Intelligence.

663
01:24:00,369 --> 01:24:03,794
I'm sorry, James.
For you I have great affection,

664
01:24:04,748 --> 01:24:09,254
but we have an old saying:
"Duty has no sweethearts."

665
01:24:11,129 --> 01:24:14,303
We have an old saying, too, Georgi.

666
01:24:14,424 --> 01:24:16,802
And you're full of it!

667
01:24:40,409 --> 01:24:42,503
Come, Kara.

668
01:24:53,088 --> 01:24:55,841
- Kara?
- Yes.

669
01:25:02,306 --> 01:25:03,853
Welcome to Afghanistan.

670
01:25:04,683 --> 01:25:07,527
Colonel Feyador, my old comrade in arms.

671
01:25:09,187 --> 01:25:15,365
I have here General Pushkin's assassin.
British Agent O07, James Bond.

672
01:25:15,444 --> 01:25:18,618
See he is sent to Moscow.

673
01:25:18,697 --> 01:25:21,120
One moment. There's one more.

674
01:25:21,199 --> 01:25:24,373
Take her, too. She's a defector.

675
01:25:26,705 --> 01:25:28,799
I will be compassionate with you

676
01:25:28,874 --> 01:25:33,129
and try to have you assigned to
the Siberian Philharmonic Orchestra.

677
01:25:33,211 --> 01:25:36,715
They're quite good
despite their bourgeois repertoire.

678
01:25:44,681 --> 01:25:49,653
I am on a secret state mission. I need
a detachment of men and some trucks.

679
01:25:55,567 --> 01:25:58,571
- Ah! What are these here for?
- For murder.

680
01:25:58,695 --> 01:26:01,665
Murder? Ah!

681
01:26:01,740 --> 01:26:05,665
I haven't had a woman prisoner
for a long time!

682
01:26:05,744 --> 01:26:07,872
(laughter)

683
01:26:09,331 --> 01:26:11,925
Come.

684
01:26:12,042 --> 01:26:15,091
Russky! Has Colonel Feyador
considered my appeal?

685
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:17,172
Yes. Good news.

686
01:26:17,255 --> 01:26:20,600
You won't be hung in the morning.
You will be shot!

687
01:26:23,345 --> 01:26:25,768
It's all a mistake! I stole nothing!

688
01:26:25,847 --> 01:26:28,350
You can tell Allah when you see him!

689
01:26:31,269 --> 01:26:34,694
<i>- Strip!
- Nye smeyete menya trogat!</i>

690
01:26:34,773 --> 01:26:39,199
Shout all you want. It's soundproofed.
They don't like to hear screaming at night.

691
01:26:41,446 --> 01:26:42,993
I didn't tell you to get down!

692
01:26:47,035 --> 01:26:49,458
I did not tell you to get up!

693
01:26:49,579 --> 01:26:51,627
Now... Get up!

694
01:26:56,795 --> 01:26:59,469
- (whistles)
- (key ring beeps)

695
01:27:02,926 --> 01:27:04,803
- (whistles)
- (key ring beeps)

696
01:27:04,886 --> 01:27:07,309
<i>(whistles "Rule, Britannia")</i>

697
01:27:15,647 --> 01:27:17,240
James!

698
01:28:00,442 --> 01:28:03,195
(prisoner laughs)

699
01:28:15,207 --> 01:28:17,881
Lock the door.

700
01:28:20,295 --> 01:28:23,174
You were fantastic! We're free!

701
01:28:23,799 --> 01:28:29,306
Kara, we're in a Russian air base in the
middle of Afghanistan. Try the small key.

702
01:28:33,391 --> 01:28:34,893
At least we're together.

703
01:28:35,727 --> 01:28:37,821
Terrific. Come on.

704
01:28:45,904 --> 01:28:48,157
Please.

705
01:28:52,077 --> 01:28:53,454
Ha ha ha ha!

706
01:30:11,364 --> 01:30:12,365
(shouts in Russian)

707
01:30:14,326 --> 01:30:16,454
(sirens)

708
01:30:27,505 --> 01:30:28,677
Come on, jump!

709
01:30:36,806 --> 01:30:38,353
(shouts in Afghan)

710
01:30:42,687 --> 01:30:45,190
- What's going on?
- I tell them you no Russian.

711
01:30:45,315 --> 01:30:47,693
- They no kill you now.
- How about later?

712
01:30:47,817 --> 01:30:51,538
Don't worry. They'll save you for the harem!

713
01:31:13,843 --> 01:31:16,221
It's the work of the mujaheddin.

714
01:31:16,346 --> 01:31:18,064
Mujaheddin?

715
01:31:18,139 --> 01:31:20,233
The Afghan Resistance.

716
01:31:24,813 --> 01:31:26,907
(shouting)

717
01:32:01,391 --> 01:32:03,439
(speaks in Afghan)

718
01:32:22,954 --> 01:32:25,048
(speaks in Afghan)

719
01:32:40,930 --> 01:32:42,978
(shouts in Afghan)

720
01:32:58,323 --> 01:33:00,826
I hope he's not invited to dinner.

721
01:33:26,684 --> 01:33:31,611
(English accent) Thank you both
for your help. My name is Kamran Shah.

722
01:33:31,689 --> 01:33:36,365
Please forgive the theatricals.
It's a hangover from my Oxford days.

723
01:33:36,486 --> 01:33:38,659
I'm sure you'd like to freshen up.

724
01:33:40,615 --> 01:33:42,709
It's all right, go ahead.

725
01:33:51,835 --> 01:33:56,056
- I have to get back to the air base.
- (laughs) You must be crazy!

726
01:33:56,131 --> 01:34:00,557
- Half the Russian army's looking for you!
- You won't help?

727
01:34:00,635 --> 01:34:03,138
No.

728
01:34:03,221 --> 01:34:05,565
Then put me in touch with the mujaheddin.

729
01:34:05,682 --> 01:34:08,185
(laughter)

730
01:34:09,894 --> 01:34:12,647
Deputy Commander of the Eastern District.

731
01:34:12,730 --> 01:34:19,079
I was caught reconnoitring the air base.
Thankfully they didn't know who I was.

732
01:34:19,154 --> 01:34:21,657
Now, who are you?

733
01:34:22,157 --> 01:34:25,832
- I work for the British government.
- (laughter)

734
01:34:27,579 --> 01:34:30,048
We've uncovered a plot by General Koskov

735
01:34:30,456 --> 01:34:32,550
to purchase American hi-tech weapons.

736
01:34:33,501 --> 01:34:35,378
Arms that could be used
against you and your men.

737
01:34:37,505 --> 01:34:41,601
That is important. You must go to
our commander in the Khyber Pass.

738
01:34:41,676 --> 01:34:45,601
That could take days. I have to get back
to the air base before Koskov leaves.

739
01:34:46,764 --> 01:34:50,769
Look, come with us tomorrow.
After our mission, I'll see what I can do.

740
01:34:50,894 --> 01:34:52,942
That'll be too late.

741
01:34:54,564 --> 01:34:57,192
- I need a gun and some guides.
- Impossible.

742
01:34:57,275 --> 01:35:00,028
I cannot spare men or the horses.

743
01:35:00,111 --> 01:35:04,287
And now it is time to rest.
We leave at sunrise.

744
01:35:18,546 --> 01:35:20,640
I was worried for you, James.

745
01:35:24,135 --> 01:35:26,263
What's going to happen to us?

746
01:35:29,641 --> 01:35:31,109
<i>Kheista.</i>

747
01:35:32,477 --> 01:35:33,478
What does that mean?

748
01:35:36,397 --> 01:35:38,991
It means beautiful...in Afghan.

749
01:35:43,571 --> 01:35:46,415
We're with the mujaheddin.

750
01:35:46,491 --> 01:35:50,337
We leave with them in the morning
on some kind of operation.

751
01:35:50,411 --> 01:35:52,755
And you're going to the Khyber Pass.

752
01:35:52,830 --> 01:35:53,831
You're not coming with me?

753
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:59,425
No. I'll catch up with you later.

754
01:35:59,504 --> 01:36:02,178
You're going back for Georgi, aren't you?

755
01:36:03,591 --> 01:36:06,845
- It's too dangerous. Don't go.
- I have to.

756
01:36:06,928 --> 01:36:10,148
You have to what? Get killed?

757
01:36:11,182 --> 01:36:14,026
- I won't wait for you.
- Fine.

758
01:36:14,143 --> 01:36:16,020
Then I'll have Kamran
send you direct to London.

759
01:36:17,188 --> 01:36:21,284
You dumb, stubborn, stupid...

760
01:36:23,361 --> 01:36:25,363
<i>Konska zadnice!</i>

761
01:36:27,865 --> 01:36:31,711
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Back end of horse!

762
01:36:31,995 --> 01:36:34,214
Are you calling me a horse's arse?

763
01:36:46,843 --> 01:36:48,595
I might never see you again.

764
01:36:52,473 --> 01:36:54,396
You will.

765
01:36:54,517 --> 01:36:56,565
I promise.

766
01:37:48,404 --> 01:37:50,452
(shouting in Afghan)

767
01:38:43,835 --> 01:38:47,590
Raw opium. Worth half a billion
dollars on the streets of New York.

768
01:38:47,672 --> 01:38:49,845
(Qunfi re)

769
01:39:02,353 --> 01:39:05,857
- What are you up to? Selling dope?
- Not so loud.

770
01:39:06,274 --> 01:39:08,777
- That's the chief of the Snow Leopards.
- Who?

771
01:39:08,860 --> 01:39:13,115
- The biggest opium dealer in the area.
- I've worked for them.

772
01:39:13,197 --> 01:39:16,622
I don't care if the Russians die
from my bullets or their opium!

773
01:39:17,034 --> 01:39:19,457
Besides, we need the money to buy arms.

774
01:39:22,123 --> 01:39:24,797
- Georgi!
- And the diamonds.

775
01:39:26,544 --> 01:39:29,889
He arranged for the Russians
to buy many hi-tech weapons.

776
01:39:30,006 --> 01:39:32,350
He's using the down payment
to buy this opium instead.

777
01:39:33,342 --> 01:39:38,644
He can turn a huge profit in days and
still provide the Russians with their arms.

778
01:39:38,723 --> 01:39:41,192
- Unless...
- Go on.

779
01:39:42,226 --> 01:39:44,069
If the opium never arrives...

780
01:39:44,145 --> 01:39:46,694
The Snow Leopard Brotherhood
are dangerous to cross.

781
01:39:47,482 --> 01:39:49,735
This is their biggest deal since the invasion.

782
01:39:50,067 --> 01:39:52,320
You won't help?

783
01:39:52,570 --> 01:39:54,243
(shouts in Afghan)

784
01:39:54,864 --> 01:39:59,335
Perhaps. As long as nothing is done
till the Russians pay up and leave.

785
01:39:59,827 --> 01:40:02,831
Right. I'll need
some plastic explosives and a timer.

786
01:40:02,914 --> 01:40:05,042
I'll see what I can do.

787
01:40:07,835 --> 01:40:09,929

(Necros shouts in Afghan)

789
01:41:43,598 --> 01:41:46,442
James is trapped. You must help him!

790
01:41:46,517 --> 01:41:49,987
- He'll have to take his chances.
- You owe him your life!

791
01:41:50,313 --> 01:41:52,941
- There's nothing more I can do.
- Yes, there is!

792
01:42:06,704 --> 01:42:09,253
- Women!
- (cheering)

793
01:43:42,133 --> 01:43:44,261
(horse whinnies)

794
01:44:01,068 --> 01:44:03,662
Wait here. We'll come back for you.

(shouts in Russian)

796

Bond!

797
01:45:14,809 --> 01:45:16,982
Don't shoot! Don't destroy the plane.

798
01:45:17,561 --> 01:45:19,905
(shouts in Russian)

799
01:47:04,835 --> 01:47:07,509
- Block the runway!
- Da.

(shouts in Russian)

801
01:48:10,818 --> 01:48:12,161
The tanker!

802
01:48:32,339 --> 01:48:34,592
James!

803
01:48:36,176 --> 01:48:38,270
(engine doesn't start)

804
01:49:23,098 --> 01:49:24,975
Where is she?

805
01:49:32,066 --> 01:49:34,160
We have to stop him!

806
01:49:36,320 --> 01:49:37,321
Kara!

807
01:50:08,769 --> 01:50:09,816
James!

808
01:50:15,484 --> 01:50:17,031
James!

(Qunfi re)

810
01:50:25,536 --> 01:50:28,665
Don't shoot! You'll hit the plane!

811
01:51:16,211 --> 01:51:17,884
- Kara!
- Oh, my God!

812
01:51:22,342 --> 01:51:23,935
Jump!

813
01:51:56,251 --> 01:51:58,379
Now that you're here, take over.

814
01:51:58,462 --> 01:52:02,137
- What?
- Hold this and keep it straight and level.

815
01:52:02,257 --> 01:52:04,134
- Where are you going?
- To defuse a bomb.

816
01:55:12,781 --> 01:55:14,499
No!

817
01:55:15,826 --> 01:55:16,998
Please!

818
01:56:08,879 --> 01:56:10,973
(bomb ticking)

819
01:56:34,237 --> 01:56:37,161
- What happened?
- He got the boot.

820
01:56:37,908 --> 01:56:39,581
(screams)

821
01:57:27,457 --> 01:57:30,131
(shouts in Afghan)

822
01:57:35,131 --> 01:57:36,974
Take over. Hold it steady.

823
01:57:37,092 --> 01:57:39,641
- Where are you going?
- To drop a bomb.

824
01:58:38,653 --> 01:58:41,202
(beeping)

825
01:58:49,873 --> 01:58:51,295
What's the matter?

826
01:58:52,917 --> 01:58:55,045
We're losing fuel fast!

827
01:59:05,764 --> 01:59:09,064
I just hope we can make Pakistan.

828
01:59:31,081 --> 01:59:33,960
There's no place to put down.

829
01:59:34,084 --> 01:59:36,928
(buzzer sounds)

830
01:59:37,003 --> 01:59:39,597
Go in the back. Get in the Jeep. Quickly!

831
01:59:55,522 --> 01:59:57,820
Fasten your seat belt!

832
02:00:09,953 --> 02:00:11,125
Hold on!

833
02:00:32,684 --> 02:00:36,985
I know a great restaurant in Karachi.
We can just make dinner!

834
02:00:45,822 --> 02:00:47,824
(call to prayer)

835
02:00:50,034 --> 02:00:54,255
<i>Whitaker's on the ground ﬂoor.
Koskov is in an upstairs bedroom.</i>

836
02:00:54,330 --> 02:00:56,674
Guard in the pool area near you.

837
02:00:58,543 --> 02:00:59,669
Guard clear. Proceed.

838
02:01:07,343 --> 02:01:09,016
<i>Hold it.</i>

839
02:01:10,430 --> 02:01:11,477
He's coming back.

840
02:01:15,435 --> 02:01:18,063
<i>Go, James. Over and out.</i>

841
02:01:18,438 --> 02:01:20,691
Well, he's in.

842
02:01:21,858 --> 02:01:23,906
(explosions)

843
02:01:45,131 --> 02:01:49,261
Pickett's charge was up
Cemetery Ridge, not Little Round Top.

844
02:01:49,385 --> 02:01:52,810
I'm replaying the battle
as I would have fought it.

845
02:01:52,889 --> 02:01:55,563
Meade was tenacious but he was cautious.

846
02:01:55,642 --> 02:01:58,612
He missed his chances
to crush Lee at Gettysburg.

847
02:01:58,728 --> 02:02:00,776
I've come for Koskov.

848
02:02:02,941 --> 02:02:07,242
Well, hell, you can have him!
Soon as I get my opium.

849
02:02:07,320 --> 02:02:10,665
- Now where is it?
- Up in smoke.

850
02:02:11,741 --> 02:02:14,915
- You burned up a half a billion bucks?
- Mm-hm.

851
02:02:17,914 --> 02:02:20,292
That's too bad, Bond.

852
02:02:20,416 --> 02:02:23,920
You know, you could have been a live,
rich man instead of a poor, dead one.

853
02:02:25,255 --> 02:02:30,352
You're finished, Whitaker. If the Russians
don't get you, the Americans will.

854
02:02:30,593 --> 02:02:32,641
Nah.

855
02:02:32,762 --> 02:02:36,983
You know, Meade should have
taken another 35,000 casualties.

856
02:02:37,767 --> 02:02:40,145
He could have ended
the rebellion right then.

857
02:02:40,270 --> 02:02:41,442
Hell, Grant would have done it.

858
02:03:10,884 --> 02:03:14,138
Right, you've had your eight.
Now I'll have my 80!

859
02:03:19,392 --> 02:03:23,522
Sorry to say your popgun is no match
for the latest body armour!

860
02:03:31,321 --> 02:03:33,369
(remote control beeps)

861
02:03:53,676 --> 02:03:59,729
Should have known you'd take refuge
behind that British vulture Wellington!

862
02:04:02,852 --> 02:04:08,109
You know he had to buy German
mercenaries to beat Napoleon, don't you?

863
02:04:08,191 --> 02:04:10,034
(wolf-whistles)

864
02:04:31,464 --> 02:04:33,558
I owed you that one, Bond.

865
02:04:37,595 --> 02:04:39,017
He met his Waterloo.

866
02:04:44,727 --> 02:04:46,570
General Pushkin!

867
02:04:47,730 --> 02:04:49,778
Thank God you're still alive!

868
02:04:52,652 --> 02:04:58,455
Whitaker has held me here for weeks.
Thank you for rescuing me! Thank you!

869
02:05:00,326 --> 02:05:02,829
Georgi! Georgi!

870
02:05:06,082 --> 02:05:09,632
- Put him on the next plane to Moscow.
- Oh, thank you, General!

871
02:05:09,752 --> 02:05:11,971
Thank you so much! Thank you!

872
02:05:12,088 --> 02:05:13,806
In the diplomatic bag.

873
02:05:21,931 --> 02:05:23,854
What about Kara?

874
02:05:23,933 --> 02:05:26,027
She is a defector, too.

875
02:05:27,311 --> 02:05:29,439
What shall we do about her?

876
02:05:31,858 --> 02:05:33,860
<i>(Dvorék "Cello Concerto ")</i>

877
02:06:27,497 --> 02:06:30,376
Are you going to stay in France now?

878
02:06:31,834 --> 02:06:34,587
Oh, you were marvellous!

879
02:06:35,713 --> 02:06:37,841
Will you excuse us?

880
02:06:41,844 --> 02:06:44,222
General Gogol, Miss Kara Milovy.

881
02:06:45,848 --> 02:06:51,526
Magnificent! I hope you can find time
to play in Moscow very soon.

882
02:06:51,604 --> 02:06:54,608
It's all right. General Gogol
is with their foreign service.

883
02:06:55,024 --> 02:06:59,825
He's arranged an immigration visa,
so you can come and go as you like.

884
02:06:59,904 --> 02:07:02,032
Wonderful!

885
02:07:06,077 --> 02:07:07,203
Excuse me.

886
02:07:09,413 --> 02:07:13,384
I'm sorry we missed the concert.
We had some trouble at the airport.

887
02:07:13,459 --> 02:07:18,056
I can't imagine why! General Gogol,
I don't believe you've met Kamran Shah.

888
02:07:18,548 --> 02:07:20,221
- My pleasure.
- Where's James?

889
02:07:21,300 --> 02:07:26,477
- Unhappily, he's on assignment abroad.
- I'll be with you shortly.

893
02:07:57,086 --> 02:08:00,511
You didn't think I'd miss
this performance, did you?

894
02:08:12,435 --> 02:08:13,687
Oh, James.
